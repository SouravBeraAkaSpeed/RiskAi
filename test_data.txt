Document Name - Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy.pdf  , Page 1  - Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Section 314(a) Policy Collections; Customer Service; Transaction Services Policy Owner: iCreditWorks Servicing Agent: Total Card, Inc. Product: iCreditWorksBIN:   GENERALThe term "section 314(a)" refers to section 314(a) of the law Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA Patriot Act) Act of 2001 Public Law 107-56.  iCreditWorks provides the 314(a) subject list to TCI every 2 weeks.  Upon review of the files, TCI conducts a one-time search of its records to identify accounts of a named suspect.  The list is compared to the master file and TCI's internal purged accounts database to match social security number (SSN)/employer identification number (EIN), then name and/or address. TCI completes their search on all subjects listed in the 314(a) request and responds by email to iCreditWorks.  A log is maintained with the date the request was received, the date the review was complete, if a match was found, the number of matches found, if the account was blocked, and the representative's name that worked the report and the resolution if any.  Under no circumstances is the customer to be informed that they are on the FinCEN list.  If the customer specifically asks if they are on the FinCEN list, you may tell them to contact FinCEN at 703-905-3770.If TCI knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that a customer may be linked to terrorist activity against the United States, TCI immediately notifies iCreditWorks.  A Suspicious Activity Narrative is filed within 10 days. A financial institution may only use the information to report the required information to FinCEN, to determine whether to establish or maintain an account or engage in a transaction, or to assist in BSA/AML compliance.  While the section 314(a) list could be used to determine whether to establish or maintain an account, FinCEN strongly discourages financial institutions from using this as the sole factor in reaching a decision to do so unless the request specifically states otherwise.  Unlike the OFAC lists, section 314(a) lists are not permanent "watch lists."  In fact, section 314(a) lists generally relate to one-time inquiries and are not updated or corrected if an investigation is dropped, a prosecution is declined, or a subject is exonerated.  Further, the names do not correspond to convicted or indicted persons; rather a 314(a) subject need only be "reasonably suspected" based on credible evidence of engaging in terrorist acts or money laundering.  Moreover, FinCEN advises that inclusion on a section 314(a) list should not be the sole factor used to determine whether to file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR).  Financial institutions should establish a process for determining when and if a SAR should be filed.VersionRevised ByBrief Summary of ChangesRevision Date1Paul FrethamNew Policy5/6/19Last Annual Review Completed by   on   Next Review Date: 6/1/2020 
. Document Name - AML Risk Assessment Methodology.docx    - AML and OFAC Risk Assessment MethodologyThe Bank’s AML and OFAC Risk Assessment process was designed after careful consideration of the guidance provided in the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual.  The process began with a review of the Bank’s overall organization structure and business mix, including product lines, geographic locations, and control functions.  The risk assessments have been developed identifying risks along with the associated mitigants.  These assessments are ongoing processes, updated according to changes in activities, services, customers/entities, etc., and presented to the Board of Directors for their review and approval.  Even is the absence of such changes, these BSA/AML/OFAC risks will be reassess at least every 12 to 18 months.              Using risk factors and assigning points to these factors permits the AML officer, executive management, and Board of Directors to gain a thorough understanding of the AML and OFAC risk profiles of the Bank.  The risk assessments also serve as a tool to identify, prioritize and ultimately manage risk.  This also allows for the concentration of those areas where the Bank has the greatest potential for exposure. Therefore, the objectives of these risk assessments are as follows:Helps to identify the areas requiring increased resources;Clarifies cost/benefits decision as to whether it makes sense to continue to offer a product or to modify a product offering;Helps to identify the need for additional monitoring/risk mitigation.The risk factors utilized in the AML assessment are as follows:Customer base risk is the risk arising from rapid growth and in diverse geographic areas resulting in the Bank not being well-familiar with their customer base.Use of third party loan brokers is the risk arising where the Bank relies heavily on third parties instead of well known and well established sources.  Purchase/Funding of Loans is the risk arising where the Bank is relying on the credit provider for CIP/AML compliance to regulations.Internet Banking is the risk arising from the number and nature of electronic banking services provided such as e-banking, transfers, bill-pay, accounts opened, etc.Presence of high risk customers or businesses is the risk arising from the volume of high risk customers/businesses such as MSBs, high volume cash businesses, foreign customers/NRAs, international, payable through, etc.Monitoring of high risk activity is the risk arising from the effectiveness of the Bank’s established procedures in initial account opening; the monitoring of deviations from expected activity (manual or systematic); sets parameters for rule-based volume and frequency; and the system of investigation.Volume of large currency transactions is the risk arising from the volume of cash transactions being conducted by the deposit base.Senior, foreign officials and politically exposed persons is the risk arising considering the level that the Bank engages or solicits senior political officials and foreign government staff.High Risk Products and Services is the risk arising from the number and nature of products such as cash management services, merchant processing, etc.Medium Risk Products and Services is the risk arising from the number and nature of products such as remote deposit capture, etc.  Foreign correspondent bank relationships is the risk arising from the volume of activities such as overseas wires, foreign exchange, pouch activity, concentration accounts, etc. processed through a foreign correspondent.Trust, fiduciary, private banking is the risk arising based on the level of trust and fiduciary offerings.International banking operations is the risk arising based on the volume of international transactions/activity.OFAC risk – problems, exposure, communication with OFAC is the risk arising from negative comments or violations communicated from OFAC.Bank locale-designated HIDTA and HIFCA is the risk arising based on whether the bank is located and/or does business in an area of high intensity drug-trafficking or financial crime.Wire Transfers is the risk arising from the volume and/or nature of wire activity such as foreign activity especially suspect regions, offshore activity, high-risk jurisdictions, etc.Staff Experience/Turnover is the risk arising based on frequency of turnover of key (front-line) customer contact staff. The risk factors utilized in the OFAC assessment are as follows:Customer Base is the risk arising from rapid growth and in diverse geographic areas resulting in the Bank not being well-familiar with their customer base.High Risk Customers or Businesses is the risk arising from the volume of high risk customers/businesses such as MSBs, foreign customers/NRAs, international, payable through, etc.Internet/Electronic Banking is the risk arising from the number and nature of electronic banking services provided such as e-banking, transfers, bill-pay, accounts opened, etc.International Activity is the risk arising based on the volume of international transactions/activity.Funds Transfer is the risk arising from the volume and/or nature of wire activity such as foreign activity especially suspect regions, offshore activity, high-risk jurisdictions, etc.ACH Transactions is the risk arising from commercial customers originating ACH transactions.Non Customer Transactions is the risk arising from conducting transactions for individuals who are not known to the bank.Foreign Relationships is the risk arising from having overseas branches and correspondent accounts with foreign banks. OFAC Exposure/Communication is the risk arising from negative comments or violations communicated from OFAC.Bank locale-designated HIDTA and HIFCA is the risk arising based on whether the bank is located and/or does business in an area of high intensity drug-trafficking or financial crime.For each risk factor category, points “0 – 8” will be assigned accordingly based on the risk factor description as well as the compensating control in effect to reduce such risk.  The points are totaled and then averaged to determine the overall AML or OFAC risk.Low Risk -  points averaged 0-2Medium Risk – points averaged 3-5High Risk – points averaged 6-8Risk scoring is a useful tool to assist in identifying areas of high risk.  This process involves the application of experience and judgment in evaluating the results.  No single risk methodology can be expected to be appropriate in all situations.  Note:  Besides the overall risk profile of the Bank, areas receiving a higher number score will have increased controls in place, enhanced due diligence for distinct activities and would require additional supervision by the AML officer.

The Rule requires all financial institutions and creditors to design and implement a risk-based program that is appropriate for the size, complexity, and nature of operations. Guidelines issues by the FDIC and other federal law enforcement agencies were used by [Insert Company Here] in designing its Program. A supplement to the Guidelines identifies 26 possible Red Flags. These Red Flags are not a checklist, but rather examples that may be used be used as a starting point in identifying concerns. [Insert Company Here]’s Program should ensure that they have appropriately addressed each of the five categories of Red Flags as necessary. These five categories are as follows:Alerts, notifications, or warnings from a CRA or other service provider;Suspicious DocumentsSuspicious personally identifying information, such as a suspicious address changeUsual use of – or suspicious activity relating to – a Covered Account; andNotices from customers, victims of Identity Theft, law enforcement authorities, or other businesses about possible Identity Theft in connection with Covered Accounts.In addition to addressing these five categories, [Insert Company Here]’s Program includes a requirement for annual review and approval of the Red Flags Program, designation of a Program Administrator, and mandatory annual training.3.1.7 Address Discrepancies.

Document Name - iCreditWorks Fraud Procedures.docx    - Fraud Prevention ProceduresProcedure Owner: Cristian MandachescuVersion:  1.0Written by: Cristian MandachescuEffective Date: 4/9/2020Table of Contents1.	Purpose and Scope	32.	Related Documents	33.	Definitions	34.	Procedures	45.	Roles and Responsibilities	6Purpose and ScopePurpose These procedures govern fraud prevention for iCreditWorks Mobile Platform at the Applicant, Device and Documentation level. This comprehensive approach covers verification of the user’s mobile phone number, device, IP address, email address, in addition to CIP, OFAC and income verification.ScopeThese procedures apply to all users of the iCreditWorks Mobile Platform during the application and servicing process.Related DocumentsThese Procedures supplement and should be read in conjunction with iCreditWorks’ Credit Policy, Credit Standard Operating Procedures, Servicing Procedures Overview, Customer Identification Program Procedures, User Identification Procedures and the Identity Theft and Red Flags Procedures.DefinitionsApplicant:  A consumer who is seeking a loan under the iCreditWorks loan program as primary borrower or co-borrower and, as such, whose name appears on the credit application and whose income and credit history are used to qualify for a loan. iCreditWorks Mobile Platform: The consumer-facing iCreditWorks mobile interface used to facilitate the credit application process and, once the loan is funded, loan payments, inquiries and other administrative activities during the life of the loan.Device ID:  A unique identifying ID with which a mobile device can be identified uniquely across the globe.IP Address:  An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to a User’s mobile phone.Identity:  Identification of a user using a govt issued valid ID like driver’s license or passport.User: An individual who registers as a user of the iCreditWorks Mobile Platform, including Applicants and Other Registered Users.Other Registered User: An individual, other than the borrower or co-borrower, who registers to use the iCreditWorks Mobile Platform after a loan is funded. Other Registered Users include users authorized to access a loan account by the borrower (i.e., an authorized user), power of attorney holders, or third parties alleging fraud.proceduresAny individual seeking to use the iCreditWorks Mobile Platform must download the app to their mobile phone and enter their mobile phone number. Fraud Procedures are performed on the User (Applicant or Borrower), Device (mobile device used) and Documentation uploaded by the user as following:Process:Device data elements are collected from the user’s device through a TransUnion (TU) SDK (software development kit) once the User downloads the iCW AppIdentity and income data elements are entered by the user on the first screen: Name, DOB (date of birth), SSN, Address, Income, Mobile Phone NumberiCW connects with TU services (iovation/ID Vision) to verify all data elements collected from the user and user’s device. If there are discrepancies in the information collected or indications that the user or device have been involved in fraudulent activity, the user is asked to upload Government issued ID and/or other documentation and additional checks are performed:Government ID is authenticated by Lexis Nexis and the information extracted from the document is cross referencedKnowledge Based Authentication (KBA) is initiated by Lexis Nexis if the ID verification process is not satisfactoryOther documentation is authenticated as described in this document and related documents and the information extracted is cross referenced against information obtained from other sourcesiCW also connects with TU to obtain a credit report and other underwriting information to validate the identity and income of user. If there are discrepancies with respect to CIP or income, the user is asked to upload documentation and additional checks are performed as described in this document and related documentsiCW performs an OFAC check based on information received from TU (IDVision)iCW asks pre-approved applicants to register in order to finalize the approval and users need to provide a valid email address that is verified during the process   As part of the registration process, iCW asks users to take a selfie using the tool embedded in the iCW app, and then uses Lexis Nexis to match the selfie to the photo in the ID by doing a multipoint biometric verificationIf the user selects not to provide a selfie, then KBA is initiated using Lexis NexisTo complete the loan approval process, iCW asks the dental partners to validate that the user is the patient they treat, based on either the selfie or a picture extracted from their Government ID, and that the amount requested is aligned with the required payment for the treatmentThe dental provider is asked to confirm the beginning or completion of treatment before the loan amount is disbursed to the dental provider. The user is notified when the dental provider confirms that treatment was initiated or completedIf the user selects AutoPay, when the user connects his/her account we confirm that the user is owner or part-owner of that accountUser verification procedures are automatically performed when an individual attempts to register as a User or when a registered User attempts to change this information in their User Profile. These procedures are described in the User Identification Procedures. If a discrepancy is identified, the User is prevented from proceeding with the registration process or the user profile change.For Documents verification, procedures combine algorithmic checks with reviews conducted by fraud specialists and are performed by iCW and its partners: Ocrolus and LSI. They include:Image Alteration Detection that automatically recognizes photoshopped and fabricated documentsData Tampering Detection that leverages document metadata and harnesses fraud specialists and a business intelligence network with hundreds of other financial services that collaborate to stop bad actors and get ahead of the latest methods used by fraudstersKBA AuthenticationThis configuration helps confirm a subject's identity by generating knowledge-based authentication questions that typically only an identity owner would know. In addition, authentication can dynamically adapt the difficulty level of a quiz based on certain high-risk events or business rules, as well as automatically adjust for minor input errors, name variations, and inconsistencies in public data. Email Risk AssessmentThis configuration analyzes the subject's input email address for fraud risk. ID VerificationThis configuration recognizes and validates government-issued IDs. The service captures the data from base64-encoded images of the ID, analyzes the graphic security elements for accuracy, and delivers the authentication results. Verification of IncomeVerification of income is completed by comparing the stated income to an income estimate model provided by TransUnion’s “Credit Vision Income Estimator” (CVIE). If the stated income is no more than 125% of the CVIE income, or it is less than the CVIE income, the stated income will be used to calculate a debt to income ratio without any additional requests for supporting documentation.  If the stated income is more than 125% of the estimated income and if the applicant does not qualify for the loan using the lower estimated income from TransUnion, Company requests the applicant to provide proof of income using paystubs, w-2s or tax returns. If Company is unable to verify income, the loan will be declined, and an adverse action will be given within 30 days of the application.IDVisionTransUnion’s IDVision Alerts facilitates compliance with sections of the Red Flags and Know-Your-Customer regulations and reduces fraud exposure by pinpointing identity and identity element misuse that may lead to payment defaults, chargeoffs and fraud-related costs. These TransUnion solutions can help detect true name and synthetic fraud, application velocity, identity relational and behavioral anomalies, SSNs belonging to deceased persons or minors,consumer statements on credit files, identity verification issues, Social Security Number issuance and misuse, address misuse, etc. Alerts returned are based on the input and/or file-based identity elements. For launch, iCW will use the best-practice settings available for this solution, and, after launch, will configure each alert individually to help meet specific fraud, compliance and identity verification strategies based on real data. There are eighty-one (81) alerts available in the IDVision solution. The alerts are based on the consumer identity element (Social Security number, address, and telephone number) and subject matter content (consumer alerts and product status). For each alert, a risk level is provided based on industry best practices to assist in determining the associated risk as well as potential follow-up strategies. The risk levels are categorized as Red, Amber or Green, depending on the number and level (high/medium/low) of alerts.Other VerificationsThis configuration can help confirm the accuracy of subject-provided identity information (for example, name, address, phone, and DOB (date of birth). Verification checks whether the data about the subject matches the data that is collected from public records and other data sources. Verification can also identify potentially high-risk situations (for example, PO Box addresses or an SSN that is associated to a deceased person).Roles and ResponsibilitiesResponsible PartyRolesiCW Chief Risk OfficerResponsible for overseeing the implementation of this procedure and for approving any changes/enhancements to this procedure.iCW Chief Information Security OfficerResponsible for monitoring implementation with respect to mobile application user security protocols and identifying opportunities to enhance these procedures.WebBankResponsible for reviewing proposed changes to this procedure.iCW Head of UnderwritingResponsible for ensuring the accuracy/currency/validity of the procedure.

This BSA/AML and OFAC Policy (“Policy”) and its program establish a framework for effective compliance with the BSA/AML and OFAC laws and regulations applicable directly to [Insert Company Here] or its business partners and to communicate its clear commitment to strong compliance culture. Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (“USA PATRIOT Act”), the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), and Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) regulations require that U.S. persons comply with applicable anti-money laundering (“AML”) and sanctions regulations. [Insert Company Here] is not a “financial institution” (as defined in the BSA at 31 U.S. Code § 5312) and therefore is not required by law to implement a BSA/AML program. However, [Insert Company Here] has made a commitment to implement an effective BSA/AML program that incorporates the regulatory expectations of its bank partners, including regulations relating to Know Your Customer (“KYC”) program and Customer Identification Program (“CIP”), transaction monitoring, referrals of potentially suspicious activity, and a comprehensive sanctions screening process.PurposeThe purpose of the Policy is to ensure that a program is in place to detect, prevent, and report illicit criminal activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing, as well as to ensure adherence to sanctions laws. The program should seek to understand and manage such risks in a systematic fashion that is compliant with Bank policy, applicable laws, regulations and guidance, and serves the best interests of [Insert Company Here], the Bank and their collective customers.ScopeThis Policy applies to all origination and servicing activities performed by [Insert Company Here] associated with the Bank’s products or services in accordance with its individual program agreement with [Insert Company Here].This Policy applies to all Business Lines and relevant support personnel at [Insert Company Here] as well as third-party partners and vendors with whom [Insert Company Here] has entered into business arrangements for ongoing operational activities. [Insert Company Here] third-party relationships include payment processors, systems providers, bank partners, and consultants, among others.Consequences of Non-Compliance[Insert Company Here] recognizes that non-compliance with BSA/AML and OFAC rules and regulations can expose the Company to substantial risk, potentially including civil or criminal penalties. All employees are responsible for understanding this Policy and undertaking any specific BSA/AML and OFAC compliance responsibilities assigned to them.Non-compliance with, or violation of, the Policy’s requirements by employees may result in:Disciplinary action, including termination in appropriate cases; and/orCivil and/or criminal penalties.Willful blindness to, or tipping off a customer about, a potential money laundering violation can expose the Company and individuals to potential liability.DEFINITIONSMoney Laundering: Money laundering is the movement of cash or cash equivalent proceeds derived from illegal or criminal activities (“illicit funds”) into, out of, or through the financial system in a manner that can give such funds an appearance of legality. Money laundering involves funds derived from criminal activities, including but not limited to drug trafficking, smuggling, human trafficking, fraud, and corruption. This typically occurs in three stages: Placement, during which illicit funds are introduced into the financial system without attracting the attention of financial institutions or law enforcement;Layering, during which illicit funds are moved through numerous layers of financial transactions in an attempt to disguise and/or conceal the true origin and ownership of those illicit funds; andIntegration, during which the now seemingly clean funds are retrieved through apparently legitimate transactions. Office of Foreign Assets Control: OFAC administers and enforces economic sanctions programs primarily against countries and groups of individuals, such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers. The sanctions can be either comprehensive or selective, using the blocking of assets and trade restrictions to accomplish foreign policy and national security goals. Terrorist Financing: Terrorist financing involves the solicitation, collection, or provision of funds to support terrorist acts or organizations. Funds used to finance terrorist activities may be derived either from criminal activity or from legal sources (e.g., charities), and the nature of the funding sources may vary according to the type of terrorist organization. This Policy does not distinguish between money laundering risk and terrorist financing risk, which are together referred to as “AML risk.”Tipping Off: Tipping off means alerting a customer to suspicions of money laundering or disclosing to a customer confidential actions taken by the Company for BSA/AML and OFAC compliance purposes, such as filing a Suspicious Activity Report (“SAR”).	Willful Blindness: Willful blindness means turning a blind eye or consciously avoiding facts or suspicions of money laundering or terrorist financing.POLICY REQUIREMENTSOverviewAlthough [Insert Company Here] is not required by law to implement a BSA/AML program, [Insert Company Here] has made a commitment to implement an effective BSA/AML program that reflects its contractual obligations as a service provider and is consistent with the regulatory expectations of its bank partners. As a U.S. company, [Insert Company Here] understands that it must comply with OFAC requirements. This Policy requires that [Insert Company Here] develop a BSA/AML and OFAC program that includes the following components:Designation of a BSA Officer and governance structure;Internal controls, including:A BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessment;KYC program;Standards for loan disbursements, payments, and refunds;OFAC compliance;Transaction monitoringReferrals for potentially suspicious activity;Regulatory reporting and recordkeeping;Information sharing;Mechanisms designed to monitor ongoing compliance; Ongoing employee training and development; andIndependent testing.Designation of BSA Officer and Governance StructureThe Board designates an experienced and knowledgeable Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”) as the BSA Officer, who has responsibility for day-to-day oversight of the Company’s BSA/AML and OFAC compliance. The Board ensures that the CCO has sufficient authority and resources to effectively execute all duties. The CCO reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and regularly apprises the Board and senior management of ongoing compliance with the BSA/AML and OFAC. The BSA Compliance Officer is designated as [Insert Company Here]’s responsible individual for day-to-day execution and oversight of the BSA/AML and OFAC programs including:Manage aspects of the [Insert Financial Institution Here] Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and OFAC programs that are outsourced to the Partner.Participate in Partner governance routines including new product developmentMaintain proficient knowledge of the rules and regulations, including but not limited to, the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), USA Patriot Act, and OFAC.Maintain awareness of industry tools, systems and processes that will keep program scalable and competitive.Coordinate the administration of independent auditor engagements and Partners testing requests.Regularly report health of program to [Insert Financial Institution Here] and Partner CommitteesSubmit ([Insert Financial Institution Here]) BSA policy exception and exemption requests to [Insert Financial Institution Here]Oversee suspicious activity monitoring operations including maintenance of surveillance software systemsConduct suspicious activity investigations as neededSubmit Suspicious Activity Report escalations to [Insert Financial Institution Here] as neededManage fraud systems and operations as applicableAssist with annual review procedures that align with this roleOversee all efforts to conduct due diligence reviews of customers, strategic partners, employees, vendors, and contractorsManage watchlist screen and other KYC systems and processes including 314(a)Manage information sharing requests including Partners requests for infoMonitor and track BSA-AML high-risk customers processes.Assist in annual review of procedures that align with this roleMaintain BSA program documentation (Procedures, Risk Assessment requests, etc.)Assist in the administration of independent audits and Partners testing request.Identify, track and drive the correction of program deficiencies (Issues Management)Track BSA policy exception and exemption requestsPlan and execute ongoing monitoring of FCC operationsAdminister BSA training programInternal ControlsBSA/AML and OFAC Risk AssessmentThe CCO conducts an annual risk assessment to identify the Program’s inherent BSA/AML and OFAC risk and the effectiveness of its controls. In conjunction with performing the risk assessment, the CCO will adopt a risk assessment methodology to support [Insert Company Here]’s risk assessment and any related BSA/AML and OFAC compliance processes.Consistent with the regulatory obligations of covered financial institutions, the risk assessment process assigns an inherent risk rating based on an assessment of customers, product and services, and geographic risks. The CCO then assesses the adequacy of the design and implementation of mitigating controls to determine the residual risk.  As part of this risk assessment, the CCO will:Identify the Company’s current overall BSA/AML and OFAC risk profile;Determine the adequacy and effectiveness of BSA/AML and OFAC controls;Evaluate the adequacy and application of BSA/AML and OFAC resources;Identify the existence of any unmitigated and/or unacceptable BSA/AML and OFAC risk; andIf necessary, recommend and implement modifications to the BSA/AML and OFAC program (and the underlying strategy, policies, and procedures) to bring the Company’s BSA/AML and OFAC risk to an acceptable level.The CCO reports the results of the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessment to the Board for review and approval. The CCO makes the assessment available to other functions within the organization.  KYC Program [Insert Company Here]’s KYC program allows the Company to identify and verify the identity of its customers with reasonable assurance. Customer Identification Program[Insert Company Here]’s CIP is a fundamental control in preventing the Company from becoming involved in money laundering, terrorist financing, or sanctions violations. [Insert Company Here]’s policy is to collect the following identity information for all of its customers, all of whom are individuals (the Company does not accept legal entities or businesses as customers):Full legal name;Date of birth;Social Security Number (“SSN”); andCurrent physical U.S. street address.In addition, [Insert Company Here] may collect information for other purposes that will deepen its understanding of customer identity. Examples could include mobile telephone numbers and device ID.[Insert Company Here] will collect this information using its proprietary mobile application and will not open an account until it has verified this information (“customer verification”) through at least one of the following criteria:Images of photo identification documents provided by the customer;[Insert Company Here]’s existing CIP data (for repeat customers);Information provided by a credit reporting agency; and/orData from external identity verification or fraud detection service providers approved by the CCO.[Insert Company Here]’s policy is not to open an account for persons who fail customer verification. The Company will never open an account for customers who:Are corporations or other entities;Give only a P.O. Box address;Give a foreign address;Do not provide each of the required pieces of information identified above;Have previously had an account closed by the Company for BSA/AML or risk/loss management reasons; orAre subject to U.S. sanctions (see section 3.3.4 OFAC Compliance below).[Insert Company Here] will ensure that it provides written notification to its customers of the USA PATRIOT Act’s customer identification requirements and will retain all CIP information for at least five years after the date of the customer’s most recent transaction or transaction attempt.Standards for Loan Disbursements, Payments, and RefundsThe Company understands that loans and monetary refunds to customers pose a potential risk for money laundering and/or terrorist financing. As a result, the Company will strictly adhere to certain standards surrounding loan disbursements, payments, and refunds, including the following:Loan proceeds may only be disbursed directly to the dental providers from whom the customers receive the treatments financed by their loans;Loan proceeds may not be disbursed to the customers or any other parties;The maximum amount of each loan is limited to the amount required for a given treatment;Customers may not make loan payments to [Insert Company Here] by cash or monetary instruments (i.e., cashier's checks, traveler's checks, and money orders) – they may through ACH transfers or by personal checks;Credit may not be refunded to an account other than the one from which the customer made the payment; andCredit may not be refunded to an individual other than the original customer.OFAC ComplianceThe CCO will establish controls to ensure that [Insert Company Here] complies with OFAC regulations to enforce economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals. The OFAC controls will apply to all parties with which the Company does business including, but not limited to, customers, suppliers, vendors, and [Insert Company Here] employees. The CCO will establish systems and procedures to ensure that the Company:Screens each customer against OFAC sanctions programs and the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (“SDN”) List prior to approving a loan;Screens suppliers, vendors, and employees prior to conducting business with them;Updates internal OFAC lists in a timely fashion when the OFAC announces changes to sanctions programs and/or SDN List;Screens all existing customers, suppliers, vendors, and employees against the SDN List when the list is updated;Blocks or rejects transactions as appropriate under U.S. sanctions law; andReports blocked and rejected items to OFAC and prepares annual reports to OFAC on the total of blocked funds.All potential matches to the SDN list will be reviewed as appropriate and either cleared or escalated timely. If a potential match cannot be confirmed as a false positive it will be promptly escalated to [Insert Company Here] BSA Compliance Officer.  Accounts or transactions that appear to be positive matches should be either blocked or rejected as appropriate.  		If a match with the SDN list is confirmed, [Insert Company Here] BSA Compliance Officer will within one day of taking any action to reject or block an account or transaction, will provide notification to the [Insert Company Here] BSA Officer in order to enable the filing of a blocked assets or rejected transactions report to OFAC. A comprehensive report of all blocked transactions through the annual period ending on June 30th of each calendar year shall be gathered and sent to the Bank in order to meet annual OFAC filing requirements.Transaction Monitoring [Insert Company Here] utilizes both automated and manual systems to monitor customer activity and to detect unusual or potentially suspicious transactions. [Insert Company Here]’s policy is to take a conservative approach to monitoring by setting low dollar monitoring thresholds and by denying accounts that display unusual activity. At a minimum, the Company will monitor for:Loan payments by third parties;Sudden/unexpected payment on loans with no evidence of refinancing or other explanation;High volumes of loan applications at a single dental practice;High volumes of fraud claims associated with a given dental practice, both by dollar amount and number of transactions;Fraudulent loan applications;Excessive overpayments or refunds;Patterns that may indicate potential criminal activity; andExcessive accounts or transactions assigned to one SSN, address, or telephone number.In addition, the Company requires all its employees to report unusual or potentially suspicious activity to the CCO, including but not limited to activity identified by fraud detection systems. The CCO will ensure that all employees receive training on how to report suspicious activity as part of the BSA/AML and OFAC training program (see section 3.4 Training and Development below).The CCO will set transaction monitoring thresholds and will have authority to make changes as needed in response to emerging patterns of activity. The CCO will document the reason for raising or eliminating a monitoring threshold and report that to the Risk Management Committee. The Board must also ratify lowering a monitoring threshold or imposing a new threshold. However, in the event that new patterns of suspicious activity emerge between meetings, the CCO is authorized to impose new thresholds pending the next Board meeting. The CCO will ensure that the rationale for all changes in thresholds is documented and retained.Referrals for Potentially Suspicious Activity Under federal law, covered financial institutions must file a SAR when a transaction is suspicious. While [Insert Company Here] is not obligated to file SARs, its relationship with its bank partners requires that it refer potentially suspicious activities that it observes as part of the customer onboarding and monitoring processes. [Insert Company Here] has implemented procedures for referring potentially suspicious activity to its bank partners and, consistent with BSA legal requirements, maintains records for customer account information (including the information obtained during the customer vetting process) for the time period required by federal obligations. The CCO oversees investigations and determines whether the Company needs to take actions, including but not limited to, referral for potentially suspicious activity and account closure. Where a referral is not made, the Company will document the basis for that decision. [Insert Company Here] will refer potentially suspicious activity to the relevant bank partner within 20 business days of reasonably becoming aware of the activity. The Company prohibits all employees from “tipping off” users that they are under investigation or that [Insert Company Here] has made referrals for their potentially suspicious activity.  In addition, the CCO may, at his or her discretion, alert law enforcement directly of activity that he or she believes will be of immediate use to a particular agency. Reportable unusual activity includes:Criminal violations involving insider abuse in any amount (insiders include directors, officers, employees, agents or other institution affiliated parties);Criminal violations aggregating $5,000 or more when a suspect can be identified;Criminal violations aggregating $25,000 or more regardless of potential suspect;Transactions conducted or attempted by, at or through   and aggregating $5,000 or more if   or the Bank suspects or has reasons to suspect the transaction:May involve potential money laundering or other illegal activityIs designed to evade the BSA or its implementing regulationsHas no business or apparent lawful purpose or is not the type of transaction that the particular customer would normally be expected to engage in, and   or the Bank knows of no reasonable explanation for the transaction after examining the available facts, including the background and possible purpose of the transaction.All information provided to the Bank to support these activities will be strictly confidential, including processes and controls within [Insert Company Here] to prevent unauthorized access or dissemination of such information.Final SAR filing decisions and activities are entirely at the discretion of the Bank.Regulatory Reporting and RecordkeepingCurrency Transaction ReportingThe Currency Transaction Report (“CTR”) requirements do not currently apply to [Insert Company Here] because the Company does not accept currency as defined by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”).  If, due to a change in the IRS’s filing requirements or [Insert Company Here] business activities, [Insert Company Here] begins accepting currency as defined by the IRS, the CCO will amend this Policy and develop procedures for filing CTRs in accordance with the relevant regulations.Purchase and Sale of Monetary Instruments RecordkeepingThe Company has no plans to purchase or sell monetary instruments.If in the future the Company develops plans to do so, the CCO will ensure that the Company develops recordkeeping procedures in advance of commencing the activity.Funds Transfer RecordkeepingThe Company allows customers and dental providers to make and receive funds transfers only through ACH payments, which are exempt from funds transfer recordkeeping requirements.If in future the Company develops plans to allow other types of funds transfers, the CCO will ensure that the Company develops recordkeeping procedures in advance of the activity commencing.Reports of International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments (“CMIRs”)The CMIRs requirements do not currently apply to [Insert Company Here] because the Company does not plan to undertake any activities that would involve transporting, mailing, or shipping monetary instruments out of or into the United States in any amount. If in the future the Company develops plans to allow other types of funds transfers, the CCO will ensure that the Company develops reporting procedures in advance of the activity commencing.Information SharingThe Company will cooperate fully with federal government authorities, law enforcement authorities, and financial institution partners on BSA/AML investigations to the extent allowable under applicable privacy and other laws.The CCO will establish systems and procedures to ensure that the Company:Establishes a central process for receiving, documenting and responding to requests for information sharing and subpoenas; andPromptly evaluates all information sharing requests received, including those from its bank partners, and provides timely responses providing all information [Insert Company Here] is legally allowed to share.Mechanisms Designed to Monitor Ongoing ComplianceStaffingThe CCO will ensure that he or she has adequate staffing, both in numbers and qualifications, to implement the Company’s BSA/AML and OFAC program effectively. At least annually, the CCO will present his or her approach to staffing to the Risk Management Committee for approval and will ensure that all activities performed on behalf of the Company comply with Company policies and procedures and all applicable regulatory requirements regardless of the personnel performing the tasks.New Products  New or modified products and business practices require, among other things, sign-off by the CCO through a separate process coordinated pursuant to the Company’s Compliance Policy and related procedure. The CCO evaluates the potential BSA/AML and OFAC risks of new or changed products and services from a compliance perspective to ensure that any BSA/AML and OFAC risks are appropriately identified and mitigated.Quality Assurance/TestingThe CCO will put in place a regular quality assurance program to ensure that the Company maintains a high quality BSA/AML and OFAC program. At a minimum, this Quality Assurance Program will review the Company’s:KYC program;Quality of transaction monitoring;Timeliness and quality of referrals to bank partners;Information sharing;OFAC screening; andRecordkeeping.The CCO will ensure that the approach to testing BSA/AML and OFAC compliance is consistent with the Company’s overarching compliance testing approach.ReportingTo ensure effective management and Board oversight of the BSA/AML and OFAC Policy and program, the CCO reports quarterly to the Risk Management Committee and annually to the Board on:BSA/AML and OFAC compliance trends; BSA/AML and OFAC quality assurance/testing results;Material BSA/AML and OFAC compliance issues and/or escalated issues;Status of BSA/AML and OFAC corrective actions;Independent testing findings, bank partner concerns, and/or regulatory concerns; andEmerging BSA/AML and OFAC compliance issues which the Company will need to address.The annual report to the Board on the state of BSA/AML compliance and any significant emerging issues will assist the Board in evaluating any Policy changes that may be appropriate.[Insert Company Here] will provide the applicable reporting to the Bank in the timeframes agreed upon between the two parties. [Insert Company Here] will also provide any required reporting to demonstrate adherence to this Policy in a format and timeframe as deemed reasonable.Training and DevelopmentThe Company requires that all employees of both [Insert Company Here] and its third-party service providers, as well as the Board, receive BSA/AML and OFAC training appropriate to their roles and responsibilities. The first training will have to be within 30 days of start date after which employees need to complete training on an annual basis.The goals of [Insert Company Here]’s BSA/AML and OFAC training program are to:Ensure [Insert Company Here]’s employees are familiar with relevant BSA/AML and OFAC requirements pertaining to their specific job functions and that they receive the most current information available;Ensure that the Board is knowledgeable regarding [Insert Company Here]’s obligations and responsibilities under BSA/AML law;Inculcate an understanding of the significance of [Insert Company Here]’s BSA/AML and OFAC compliance efforts and help develop a strong culture of compliance across the Company; andDevelop a cadre of staff and managers throughout [Insert Company Here] to detect, escalate, and manage BSA/AML and OFAC compliance-related risks as and when they arise.Consistent with [Insert Company Here]’s Compliance Policy, the CCO is responsible to ensure that the BSA/AML and OFAC training program is incorporated into the annual compliance training plan.Independent TestingThe Board oversees the completion, at least annually, of an independent test of [Insert Company Here]’s BSA/AML compliance by a qualified third-party firm, for assessing the implementation and effectiveness of the Company’s BSA/AML and OFAC Program and the adequacy of its controls over BSA/AML and OFAC compliance risk. The CCO is responsible for updating [Insert Company Here]’s risk assessment in light of any issues raised during the independent testing and taking necessary corrective action to remediate findings.  The engagement will include, at a minimum:An evaluation of the overall effectiveness of the BSA/AML/Sanctions Compliance Program, including related Policies, SOPs, and processesRisk-based transaction testing to verify the adherence to BSA/AML/Sanctions recordkeeping and reporting requirementsAn evaluation of Management’s efforts to resolve violations and deficiencies noted in previous audits and/or regulatory examinationsA review of BSA/AML staff training for adequacy, accuracy, and completenessA review of the effectiveness of the suspicious activity monitoring systems used for BSA/AML compliance.An assessment of the overall process for identifying and reporting suspicious activity to [Insert Financial Institution Here], including a review of filed or prepared SARs for accuracy, timeliness, completeness, and adherence to the Policy.An assessment of the integrity and accuracy of Management Information Systems (MIS) used in the BSA/AML/Sanctions Compliance Program.Draft and final reports will be made available to the Bank and issues noted within the report will include [Insert Company Here] management response and will be tracked and remediated in a timely manner.ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIESResponsible PartyRolesBoard of DirectorsDesignate a BSA Officer;

As such, these CIP Procedures describe:Identifying information that is obtained from every customer opening a new accountTechnology utilized to verify identifying information provided by a customer in the course of opening an iCW accountActions taken by iCW in the event that the Company is unable to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of a customerRecords created and maintained by iCW with respect to its CIPGovernment lists utilized at onboardingCustomer notice of iCW’s efforts to collect and maintain records related to the CIPScopeThese Procedures govern all aspects of iCW’s CIP, and they are applicable to all personnel at iCW, including both employees and consultants. It is also applicable to all third parties with whom iCW has business arrangements for ongoing operational activities. Third parties include, but are not limited to, dental office partnerships, bank partnerships, and service providers.Related Documents and governing lawPolicies and Procedures:BSA/AML and OFAC PolicyCompliance Management System PolicyWatchlist Screening ProceduresData Handling and Retention PolicyGoverning Law:31 CFR § 1020.220CUSTOMER INFORMATION REQUIREDiCW’s CIP is fundamental in preventing the Company from becoming involved in money laundering, terrorist financing, or sanctions violations. In the course of onboarding a customer, iCW collects the following data: NameFirst nameLast nameAddressStreet addressCityStateZip CodeIdentification NumberSocial Security Number (SSN)Date of BirthDate of birthThe Company will never open an account for customers who:Are corporations or other entities;Give only a Post Office Box as an address;Give a foreign address;Do not provide each of the required pieces of information described above;IDENTITY VERIFICATIONiCW primarily employs non-documentary methodologies for verifying identifying details input by loan applicants, which consists of comparing applicant data with information obtained via a consumer reporting agency (TransUnion).TransUnion specifically evaluates identity verification risk via analyzing applicant inputs (first name, last name, address, SSN, and date of birth) against multiple data sources and produces an output risk score for each applicant (pass, flag, or fail).If an applicant’s TransUnion risk output is  “pass”, no serious identification red flags were uncovered, and the application will continue along a standard underwriting and processing path.If an applicant’s risk output is “flag” based on a CIP-relevant datapoint, they will be asked to provide an answer to a knowledge-based authentication (KBA) question and prompted for additional verification documents to remediate the specific flag condition(s). The only instance in which a KBA alone may serve to verify a portion of the applicant’s identity are for instances when the specific flag condition generated is regarding the applicant’s address. All other flag conditions (name, SSN, and DOB) must be remedied with documentary evidence. If the additional verification is not received or does not validate the flag condition, the customer must be declined. The table below lists acceptable documents to remediate specific flag conditions.Flag ConditionAcceptable Remediation DocumentsFirst and/or Last NameUnexpired driver’s licenseUnexpired military IDUnexpired passportUnexpired state IDBirth certificateMarriage certificateSocial Security cardCourt decree of a legal name changeAddressUnexpired driver’s licenseUnexpired state IDUtility bill*Mobile phone bill*Pay stub*W-2 from the year immediately prior1099 from the year immediately priorCurrent rental agreement or mortgage statementProperty deedBank statement*SSNSocial Security cardW-2 form1099 formFederal tax transcriptPay stub if it lists a SSNDate of BirthDriver’s licenseState IDPassport*Document must be dated within 60 days of the application date. Finally, TransUnion may have a risk output of “fail”. In this instance, the loan application cannot proceed until the applicant remediates the matter directly with the credit bureau.The nature of a mobile lending platform is such that applicants will not appear in person in a traditional brick and mortar financial institution. Due to this, applicants are also required to upload either a driver’s license, state ID, Military ID, or Passport into the App. The photo identification provided is then matched to the individual making the loan application either by utilizing facial recognition software via a “selfie” or by prompting them to correctly answer a KBA question. If the applicant has previously correctly answered a KBA question, the photo identification will be accepted without the need to do so again.If the applicant is unable to pass verification, iCW will not form a customer relationship with the applicant. RECORDKEEPINGiCW retains all CIP information for a minimum five (5) years after the date the account was closed, in a manner consistent with the iCW Data Handling and Retention Policy. CIP records are retained on a secure Amazon Webservice database (Database).Information retained in the Database must include – Customer name; date of birth; and physical addressCustomer SSNWhether the photo identification produced is a passport, military ID or state driver’s license/state IDWhether the customer has opted to utilize the facial and vocal recognition features of the application (a description of non-documentary methods used to verify the identity of a customer)If applicable, a description of the resolution of any substantive discrepancy discovered when verifying identifying informationCOMPARISON WITH GOVERNMENT LISTSThe Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) requires that all persons and entities in the United States block of freeze property, payment of any funds, transfers, and transactions with anyone on OFAC watchlists. Accordingly, iCW will not fund an account until further investigations reveals that the “hit” on the list is not a legitimate match.To comply with this requirement at onboarding, iCW utilizes TransUnion’s OFAC Name Screen service, which screens consumer information against the following watchlists:Specially Designated Nationals (SDN)Specially Designated Terrorist (SDT)Specially Designated Kingpins (SDNTK)Foreign Sanctions Evaders (FSE)Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO)Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC)Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers (SDNT)Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT)TransUnion compares consumer name and date of birth against the aforementioned watchlists for potential matches and generates OFAC alerts if there is an 85 percent degree of matching or greater. What this means is that the matching logic utilized by TransUnion will detect certain misspellings or other incorrectly entered text, and will return near, or proximate matches. This 85 percent threshold is also referred to as a minimum name score.Due Diligence: Given that the minimum name score is placed at 85, if TransUnion’s software detects a possible match, TransUnion will place an OFAC alert on the credit report and remit to Lending Solutions, Inc. (LSI) to determine whether it is a legitimate match.LSI will either disposition a TransUnion OFAC alert as a “true match” or a “false positive” by manually checking the information contained within an OFAC list against information provided by the applicant. Regardless of the outcome, all OFAC alerts dispositioned by LSI must be shared with iCW immediately upon receipt and disposition.In the event that LSI deems the match legitimate, the BSA/AML Manager (or a designee) at iCW will perform further due diligence using LexisNexis and information obtained via iCW’s Customer Identification Program (CIP). If the BSA/AML Manager believes that the individual is on an OFAC list, they must inform WebBank via Salesforce within one (1) business day of receiving the LSI disposition.iCW will investigate all details surrounding the attempt to acquire a loan to ascertain if a Suspicious Activity Report is also required in accordance with the Suspicious Activity and Reporting ProceduresInstances of legitimate list matches are retained for five (5) years for audit and regulatory purposes.CUSTOMER NOTICEThe following notice regarding CIP is embedded with the iCW application, which is available for customer review prior to officially opening an account:In accordance with Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act signed October 26, 2001, all financial institutions are mandated to implement a Customer Identification Program (CIP) as a tool to protect the U.S. financial system from money laundering, terrorist financing, identity theft and other forms of fraud. iCreditWorks is required to: *Obtain customer identifying information from each customer prior to account opening and in identifying signatory individuals added to an existing or new account. *Maintain records of the information used to verify the person’s identity including name, address and other identifying means. In all cases protection of our customer’s identity and confidentiality is iCreditWorks pledge to you. We proudly support all efforts to protect and maintain the security of our customers and our country.TESTING PROCEDURES AND CONTROLSIndependent testing: Annually, iCW will support WebBank to secure the services of an independent third party with credible industry experience to test its CIP procedures and controls at least once every calendar year as part of the iCW’s overall obligation to engage an independent party to audit its overall compliance program.The independent testing report will include the name or qualifications of the independent auditor; objective and scope of the review; procedures performed, and transaction testing completed; and findings or recommendations identified including management’s response.  Any violations, policy or procedure exceptions, or other deficiencies and recommendations noted during the review will be reported in a timely manner to the iCW Board. The Board, through the Chief Compliance Officer, will track audit report findings and implement and document corrective actions.Internal Review: At least once a year, iCW will provide a report to WebBank on the overall effectiveness of its Customer Identification Program. The report provided to the Bank by iCW will contain a write-up covering: The effectiveness of these Procedures in assessing customer identity;Service provider arrangements;Significant breaches of procedure and management response; andRecommendations for needed changes in the Customer Identification Program.ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIESChief Compliance Officer:Oversee and provide guidance to the overall administration to the CIPReview and approve changes to the CIP ProceduresBSA/AML Manager:Updates the CIP ProceduresDispositioning alerts from relevant government lists (ascertains whether an alert or match is legitimate)dOCUMENT mANAGEMENTiCW will maintain the Procedures and supporting documentations in accordance with the iCW Data Handling and Retention Policy. iCW will ensure all employees understand their obligations in retaining documents and are aware of the processes for retention and disposal of records.Modified DateModified ByApproved ByRevisionVersionApproved DateApproved ByVersionJuly 22, 2020WebBank1.0
. Document Name - Anti-Money Laundering-Know Your Customer Policy.docx    - Anti-Money Laundering/Know Your Customer PolicyIntroductionThis Policy establishes a set of minimum standards for identifying, accepting, documenting, and approving customers and maintaining customer relationships.  It also identifies a set of money laundering risk ratings, and includes standards for performing account surveillance, and maintaining records.Non-compliance with the requirements of this policy could seriously undermine the reputation of and public confidence in the Bank and could result in disciplinary actions against the Bank and its employees, including civil and criminal penalties and other sanctions.The U.S. Congress enacted the Bank Secrecy Act in October 1970 to prevent banks and other financial service providers from being used as intermediaries to hide the transfer or deposit of money derived from criminal activity.  Since its passage, Congress has amended the BSA a number of times to enhance law enforcement effectiveness.  The reporting and recordkeeping requirements of the BSA regulations create a paper trail for law enforcement to investigate money laundering schemes and other illegal activities.  This paper trail operates to deter illegal activity and provides a means to trace movements of money through the financial system.The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (USA PATRIOT Act) was signed into law by President Bush on October 26, 2001, and contains strong measures to prevent, detect, and prosecute terrorist financing and international money laundering.  Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act is the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001.  It includes provisions for fighting international money laundering and blocking terrorist access to the U.S. financial systems.  ObjectivesThe primary objective of this Policy is to help protect the good name and reputation of the Bank, and to secure its premises and systems against misuse as a vehicle for money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illegal activities.  Specific objectives include the following:To ensure compliance with applicable U.S. and local anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing laws and regulations while protecting the financial privacy and relationship between the Bank and its customersTo establish minimum standards needed to determine and verify the identity of new customers and any other relevant account parties, and to require the application of enhanced due diligence standards to those customers considered higher-risk as a matter of law or regulations, or based upon the Bank’s own assessment of riskTo set appropriate standards for the ongoing conduct of customer relationshipsTo institute sound account/transaction surveillance standards as a mechanism for enabling Bank personnel to recognize, detect, and report money laundering, terrorist financing, and/or suspicious activity occurring through Bank accountsTo delineate the responsibilities of employees who implement the Bank’s AML processes.PolicyThe Bank will comply with the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), the USA PATRIOT Act, and other applicable AML laws and regulations.  Also the Bank, consistent with applicable law, cooperates with governmental and law enforcement authorities in the enforcement of AML laws and regulations in connection with transactions involving the Bank.No director, officer or employee of the Company shall:Knowingly engage in, or assist any other person or entity in engaging in, any activity believed by such director, officer or employee to involve money laundering, terrorist financing or other suspicious or criminal activityAssist any customer in structuring financial transactions in order to avoid disclosure to governmental or law enforcement authorities under applicable lawAdvise any customer that their information has been, or will be, reported to governmental or law enforcement authorities (unless informing the customer is permissible, such as during the preparation of a Currency Transaction Report)Make a conscious decision to avoid learning the truth about a customer’s suspected illegal activities.Any director, officer or employee of the Company who fails to adhere to any of the foregoing policies may be subject to immediate demotion, reassignment or dismissal, and such failure may cause such individual and the Bank to be subject to severe civil and/or criminal penalties.Money Laundering and Terrorist FinancingMoney Laundering is the involvement in any one transaction, or series of transactions, which assists a person in keeping, concealing or disposing of the proceeds derived from illegal activities.  It is the criminal act of processing “dirty” money, through a series of transactions; in this way the funds are “cleaned” so that they appear to be proceeds from legal activities.  Refer to Appendix A for examples of suspicious conduct and transactions related to money launderingAlthough money laundering is a complex process, it basically involves the following three steps that can occur independently or simultaneously:The first stage of laundering money is placement.  The goal is to introduce the unlawful proceeds into the financial system without attracting the attention of financial institutions or law enforcement.  Placement techniques include structuring currency deposits in an amount to evade reporting requirements or commingling currency deposits of legal and illegal enterprises.  An example may include dividing large amounts of currency such as purchasing a series of monetary instruments.The second stage of the money laundering process is layering, which involves moving funds around the financial system, often in a complex series of transactions, to create confusion.  Examples of layering include wiring funds to and through numerous accounts at many institutions.The final stage of the process is integration.  Once the funds are in the financial system and obstructed through the layering stage, the integration stage is used to further create the appearance of legal funds through additional transactions.  Examples include the real estate transactions or investment securities.Terrorists generally finance their activities through both unlawful and legitimate sources.  Unlawful activities, such as extortion, kidnapping, and drug trafficking, have been found to be a major source of funding.  Other observed activities include improper use of charitable or relief funds that donors may have no knowledge that their donations have been diverted to support terrorist causes.  Other legitimate sources have also been found to provide terrorist organizations with funding; these legitimate sources are a key difference between terrorist financiers and traditional criminal organizations.Prohibited CountriesThe Bank may determine that it will not process transactions involving certain countries, or maintain or open new accounts for clients located in certain countries, because of publicly reported concerns of law enforcement agencies and regulators with respect to money laundering controls in those countries.  As events change, the Bank may add or delete countries from this prohibition.Refer to Appendix B for Countries Tiering List         .Know Your Customer StandardsSound business practices include the concept of knowing your customer.  Observing the standards within this Policy can greatly reduce the risk that the Bank might be used for unlawful purposes.  A sound Know Your Customer Policy include, at a minimum:Establishing the true identity of the customer and other related parties to the account, as appropriateScreening customer and, as appropriate, related party names against government listsObtaining additional information/documentation as needed to understand the customer’s level of risk, determine the need for enhanced due diligence, and enable the detection of suspicious activityDetermining the customer source of fundsUnderstanding and recording the account’s purpose and anticipated transaction behaviorMaintaining up-to-date knowledge of the customer through ongoing client contact and periodic reviews.Prohibited CustomersThe Bank intends to do business with reputable customers whose identity can be verified.  The Bank will not knowingly do business with persons or entities with whom the Bank is prohibited from doing business because they are sanctioned under the U.S. Embargo Programs or any other official government lists that are identified and distributed throughout the Bank or are applicable in the local jurisdiction.  Also those with whom the Company has chosen not to do business based on prior experience.  In addition, Shell Banks which is one that does not have a physical presence in any country.  Physical presence is defined as a place of business that (1) is maintained by a non-U.S. bank; (2) is located at a fixed address in a country in which the non-U.S. bank is authorized to conduct banking activities, at which location the non-U.S. bank employs one or more individuals on a full-time basis and maintains operating records related to its banking activities; and (3) is subject to inspection by the banking authority that licensed the non-U.S. bank to conduct banking activities.Also, the Bank will not knowingly do business with individuals or entities:Whose character or financial conduct are suspect at the inception of the relationship or becomes suspect at any time during the relationshipConvicted of money laundering or related financial crimeWho attempt to establish anonymous accounts, accounts in obviously fictitious names or accounts where the identity of the true beneficial owner of the funds is required but cannot be obtainedWho refuse to provide information required by the BankCustomer Identification Program (CIP)Minimum identifying information must be obtained, recorded and verified for any new customer prior to opening their first account or providing their first product/service.  For the purpose of CIP requirements, a customer is defined as any person, including both individuals and entities (e.g., corporations, partnerships and trusts), that opens a new account, product or service, including deposit, transaction, asset, securities, safekeeping, collateral, or mutual fund accounts, credit, lending or borrowing activities, a safe deposit box, or cash management, custody, trust or estate services.  Typically, the customer is the accountholder.  In cases where an individual opens an account on behalf of a person who lacks legal capacity, such as a minor or an entity that is not a legal person, the individual opening the account is the customer.  The following entities are excluded from the definition of customer for CIP purposes:Financial institutions regulated by a U.S. Federal functional regulator or banks regulated by a U.S. state bank regulatorDepartments or agencies of the U.S., including any state or political subdivision of any stateEntities established under the laws of the U.S., state laws, political subdivision of any state, or under an interstate compact, that exercise governmental authority on behalf of the U.S., or any such State or political subdivisionPublicly listed entities whose common stock or similar equity interests are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, or the NASDAQ Stock Market.For new customers who are individuals, including joint accountholders, the following identification information must be obtained and recorded:NameDate of birthPrimary residence address (and mailing address, if different from residence address).  For a customer who does not have a residential or mailing address, a business street address, an Army Post Office or Fleet Post Office box number or the residential or business address of next of kin or of another contact individualGovernment issued identification number – For U.S. individuals, this number must be the Social Security Number.  For non-U.S. individuals/foreign based individuals, the number can be a taxpayer identification number, passport number, national identification number, resident’s identification number, alien identification number, or another government-issued identification number.For new customers who are entities, the following identification information must be obtained and recorded:Legal namePrincipal place of business address (or local office address)Government issued identification number – For U.S. entities (established or organized in the U.S.), this number must be the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN/Employer Identification Number (EIN).  For non-U.S. entities/foreign based individuals, this number can be a taxpayer identification number, registration number, or another government-issued identification number.  Alternative government-issued documentation that certifies existence must be requested for any non-U.S. entities that do not have an identification number.There may be instances (i.e., a newly formed entity) when the customer has applied for the TIN/EIN, but it has not been received at the time the account is requested.  In all cases, the TIN/EIN must be obtained by the Bank within 60 days or the account must be closed.  The Bank will track accounts opened without TINs/EINs, and may consider restricting account usage, such as limiting deposits, withdrawals, check writing, extension of credit or other measures while receipt of the TIN/EIN is pending.The identification of each customer is typically verified before or at account opening.  For all businesses, verification must be accomplished no later than 30 days after account opening.  Identity verification can be accomplished through documentary or non-documentary means or a combination of both.  Depending on the risks associated with the customer, businesses may consider whether to restrict the customer’s activities until such time that the verification has been completed.Documentary verification is accomplished by obtaining, reviewing, and making a record of one acceptable form of identification document.  For individual customers, acceptable identification documents include unexpired, government-issued photo IDs, such as:PassportDriver’s license or non-driver photo ID cardMilitary ID cardFor businesses/entities, acceptable identification documents include:Certificate of Incorporation/Filing ReceiptGeneral or Limited Partnership AgreementArticles of Organization or Association/Certification of FormationTrust InstrumentLetters of Trusteeship or ExecutorshipU.S. Internal Revenue Code Sec. 501(c)(3) letter (for nonprofit organizations)A government-issued business licenseFor foreign based entities, those legal documents issued by other countries that parallel the above and authenticate the entity will be accepted upon verification.These documents are to be used to confirm the accuracy of the information provided by new customers.  A record of the document(s) used must be retained on file and should include:  a description (i.e., the type of document), its identification number, the place of issuance, the date of issuance, and the expiration date (as applicable).  A photocopy of the document (should the business choose to make and retain photocopies) will satisfy this requirement. Refer to Appendix C for further description of documentary verification documents         The Bank may choose to perform non-documentary verification in addition to, or instead of, placing reliance on the documents named above.  Non-documentary verification may include, but is not limited to:Contacting the customer at home after the relationship has been establishedObtaining references from reliable sources (e.g., credit bureaus, other financial institutions)Performing a site visit at the entity customer’s place of business.Even when not required, non-documentary verification may be considered an additional safeguard, particularly in higher-risk businesses and with high-risk customers.  When non-documentary verification is used, a record must be made and retained of the methods undertaken to verify the identity of a customer; this record should include a description of the methods and the results of verification performed.During the course of verifying the identity of a customer, discrepancies may arise between the information obtained from the customer and the information obtained during the verification.  Resolutions resulting in the continuing the relationship need to be further documented and approved by a Vice President or above.Bank employees are under no obligation to continue the customer identification and verification process if, at any time during this process, they determine that it is in the best interest of the Bank to terminate the relationship or discontinue the customer acceptance process.  If the decision to discontinue customer acceptance is based on a CIP failure and is deemed suspicious, an Incident Report Form must be filed even though accounts are not opened.The USA PATRIOT Act requires that, prior to opening an account that the Bank notify its customers that it will be requesting information to verify their identity.  The Bank’s signage/brochure will include the following language:Important Information About Procedures For Opening a New AccountTo help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, financial institutions are required by Federal law to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each individual or entity that opens an account or requests credit.What this means for individuals:  When an individual opens an account or requests credit, we will ask for their name, residence address, date of birth, tax identification number, and other information that allows us to identify them.  We may also ask to see a driver’s license, passport or other identifying documents.What this means for other legal entities;  When a corporation, partnership, trust or other legal entity opens an account or requests credit, we will ask for the entity’s name, physical address, tax identification number, and other information that will allow us to identify the entity.  We may also ask to see other identifying documents, such as certified articles of incorporation, partnership agreements or a trust instrument.New Account ReviewWithin five business days, the branch manager or designee will review new account information and supporting documentation to determine whether all the necessary information was obtained, the account appears suspicious in any manner, the risk rating is proper and the type of account/business/customer is in compliance with bank policy.  Also as part of this review, the branch manager or designee validates the information on the Insight system to ensure accuracy.  The branch manager or designee signs the “Account Opening Data Entry Form” as evidence of the review and approval.OFAC Screening/Comparison with Government ListsUpon opening an account, the related party names are screened against the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanction list.  Upon receipt of an update of the OFAC sanction list, the entire portfolio is scanned against this sanction list.  Possible matches are investigated and any true matches are escalated to the OFAC Compliance Officer for resolution.The new account will also be scanned to determine whether the customer appears on any list of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations issued by any Federal government agency and designated as such by Treasury in consultation with the Federal functional regulators.  Possible matches are investigated and any true matches are escalated to the BSA/AML Compliance Officer.  The BSA/AML Compliance Officer is responsible to ensure that all federal directives issued in connection with these lists are followed.KYC Due Diligence RequirementsKYC due diligence must be performed on all new customers at the time the relationship with the Bank is first established.  For the purposes of KYC, the customer is each person in whose name an account is opened or a product/service is initiated.  This person can be an individual, a company, an organization or other entity.  The Bank will obtain information and perform due diligence on related parties where appropriate.  Related parties include persons who have authority, or who are in a position of control, over the account, product or service, as well as the beneficial owner(s) of the assets and persons who are intended to receive a benefit from, or be a recipient under, the relationship.  The following are some examples of related parties:The account’s nominal and/or beneficial owner(s)For an account in the name of an agent, the principalFor a company account, the significant owners, principal officers, key senior managers, and directors of the companyFor an account in the name of a trust, the donor, trustees, and executors.When opening a new account for an existing customer, it is not necessary to re-perform customer identification/verification steps provided that the existing customer information is current and complete and the Bank maintains the reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of the customer.  Additional account level data, however, may be needed in certain circumstances relative to any additional accounts offered to existing customers.  Similar account level data may also be necessary when a new account is opened for a new customer.  Depending on the type of account, such additional information may include, but is not limited to:Type and purpose of accountSource of initial and ongoing fundingAnticipated activity:  the anticipated usage, activity, types of transactions, volumes and dollar amountsMoney Laundering Risk RatingsMoney laundering risk ratings are an evaluation of the customer’s/account’s potential money laundering risk.  As such, they can impact the approvals needed to accept a customer or open the account, determine the extent of information and verification required, trigger the need for enhanced due diligence, and affect the frequency of periodic relationship reviews.The relationship owner determines the money laundering risk rating but will be reviewed by another individual.  Money laundering risk ratings must be determined before a new customer is accepted, and at, or immediately after, a new account is opened.  They are to be re-evaluated and adjusted, as appropriate, during the periodic review process, or at any other time when the business learns of new information that affects the rating.  The branch manager is responsible for reviewing or approving changes to a client’s risk rating.Money laundering risk ratings apply at both the customer and account level.  If a customer is high-risk by himself, because for example he is a politically exposed person or associated with a high-risk industry, then all of his accounts should be classified as high-risk.  If an account is rated high-risk, however, the associated customer is not automatically high-risk.Risk determination is a two-part process.  First, the relationship owner must identify and understand the general operating and overall legal, regulatory and geopolitical environments in which their customers operate.  Second, the relationship owner must, at a minimum, understand the following to determine whether they want to enter into, or sustain, a relationship with a particular customer within their target market:The nature of the customer, including their reputation and business or other financial activitiesThe products and services requested, and the customer’s purpose for and use of such products and servicesThe money laundering risks associated with the customer and the jurisdiction(s) with which the customer has significant contact.Also the following risk factors will be considered:Customer-Type – At a minimum, the following customers shall be considered high-risk:  Politically Exposed Persons, Money Services Businesses, Offshore International Business Corporations and Private Investment Companies, any customers associated with substantial negative public information.Geography – At a minimum, customers associated with (i.e., located/domiciled in, a citizen or resident of, and/or has business activities in) a Tier 1 country shall be considered high-risk.  Refer to Appendix B for the Country Tiering ListIndustry – At a minimum, customers associated with (i.e., one is principally engaged in or whose source of wealth was generated from) a high-risk industry shall be considered high-risk.  Refer to Appendix D for the High- and Medium-Risk Industries ListProducts and Services – At a minimum, customers and/or accounts that use high-risk products or services shall be considered high-risk.  Refer to Appendix E for the High-Risk Products ListTransaction Activity – Such as whether the customer’s expected transaction activity, including cash and/or wire activity, is determined to be high.Additional KYC Due Diligence Requirements for Certain Customers, Related Parties, and AccountsNew High-Risk CustomersAll new customer relationships that are deemed high-risk, and those escalated from medium or low to high-risk, are subject to review and approval by the Chairman of the Board.  The Standard Account Review Sheet is subject to completion, review and approval based on established requirements.Refer to Appendix F for Standard Account Review SheetPolitically Exposed PersonsCustomers/related parties who are Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) increase the risk that the Bank could be exposed to involvement in money laundering or other illegal activities.  The financial activities of PEPs may be of public interest or might otherwise attract publicity within or beyond the borders of their home country, and their transactions with the Bank could potentially involve the proceeds of foreign official corruption.  If the Bank knowingly engages in financial transactions in violation of the money laundering laws of various jurisdictions, the Company will be exposed to significant legal and reputational harm.PEPs are defined as a U.S. or non-U.S., current or former, senior official of the executive, legislative, administrative, military or judicial branches of a government, whether elected or not and include senior officials of a major political party or a senior executive of a government-owned commercial enterprise.  A senior official or executive is defined as an individual with substantial authority over policy, operations, or the use of government owned services.  PEP positions include, but are not limited to:Heads of State, Government Heads or National Leaders, such as the President, Prime Minister, King, Queen, Emir, Sultan, Emperor, Monarch, PopeNational Cabinet Members and Department/Agency Heads, such as the Vice President, Chancellor, Secretary of State, Defense Minister, Chief of the Treasury, Head of the National Bank, and other key Department, Agency, Ministry, and Office OfficialsKey National Legislative Officials, such as Congressmen, Senators, House Representatives, Parliament members, Assemblymen, CouncilmenSenior Military Leaders, such as the Army SecretaryImportant National Justices, such as the Attorney General, Chief Justices, and Associate JudgesPolitical Party LeadersAmbassadors/Consuls General, including the United Nation RepresentativeGovernorsMayors of cities with populations in excess of 1MMSenior executives of government-owned enterprises, such as the Chairman, CEO and President of government airline.The following customers/related parties are also PEPs and are therefore bound by the requirements of this section:Corporations, businesses or entities formed by, or for the benefit of, or significantly owned or controlled by, a PEP; significant ownership is 25% or more; control includes holding a senior executive position of influence, such as the Chairman, CEO, and PresidentAny immediate family member of a PEP, including the spouse, parents, siblings, children, and spouses’ parents or siblingsA person who is widely and publicly known to be a close associate of any such individualForeign Embassies/Consulates/MinistriesForeign political organizations.Upon account opening, reasonable steps will be taken to determine whether customers and related parties are PEPs including the direct inquiry with the customer.  The customer’s KYC profile and account record must indicate that the client is a PEP.Enhanced scrutiny is required whenever the Bank does business with a PEP.  This enhanced scrutiny includes the following:Determining the identity of the PEPAssessing the level of corruption and characteristics associated with the PEP’s countryEvaluating the PEP’s position, length of time in office, and reputationProbing the PEP’s employment history and source of funds and wealthObtaining information on immediate family members or close associates having transaction authority over the accountUnderstanding the purpose of the account and expected volumes and nature of account activityConsidering the use of the account(s)Performing appropriate database/internet checks to gather informationObtaining Board of Directors approval before account opening (presentation to outline the nature of the request, explanation of the rationale for initiating or maintaining the PEP relationship and providing adequate information regarding the PEP, the due diligence steps taken in regard to the relationship and how the PEP’s ongoing activities with Bank will be monitored.)On an annual basis, each Business Head must review the PEPs in his or her business to determine if their retention continues to be appropriate.  This review must be evidenced in writing. Money Services BusinessesMoney Service Businesses (MSBs) are high-risk because many:Lack ongoing customer relationships and require minimal or no identification of customersMaintain limited or inconsistent recordkeeping on customers and transactionsEngage in frequent currency transactionsAre subject to varying levels of regulatory requirements and oversightCan quickly change their product mix or location and quickly enter or exit an operationSometimes operate with improper registration or licensingMSBs are defined as any person doing business, whether or not on a regular basis or as an organized business concern, in one or more of the following capacities:Currency dealer or exchangerCheck casher, including “payday” loan and check cashing servicesIssuer of traveler’s checks, money orders or stored value productsSeller or redeemer of traveler’s checks, money orders or stored value products (including the United States Postal Service)Money transmitterIt is the policy of the Bank not to do business with MSBs, except for:U.S. or state-regulated mortgage banking firmsRecognized national or regional retail chain stores whose principal business is not money services.For any other MSBs, Board of Directors approval is required.  In addition, the following due diligence must be performed for all MSB relationships, whether or not Board approval is required:Confirm that the MSB is registered with FinCENConfirm state and local licensing, if applicableConfirm agent status, if applicableConduct an on-site visitDetermine and review the ownership of the MSB.Hedge FundsHedge funds may be higher-risk because they provide customers with offshore investment vehicles.  Hedge funds are similar to mutual funds in that they both are pooled investment vehicles that accept investors’ money and generally invest it on a collective basis.  Hedge funds differ significantly from mutual funds, however, because hedge funds are not regulated.Before opening an account for a hedge fund, the following due diligence will be performed:Obtain and review a prospectus, offering document or other documentation describing the fundRecord the name of and background information for the investment advisor/management company and/or the general partners or other similar senior officers, such as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Chief Information Officer, etc.Perform OFAC screenings on the fund, the investment advisor/management company, and/or the general partners or other similar senior officers by conducting Internet research or another similar service or third party confirmation.Reliance on OthersIn those instances in which a financial intermediary introduces its client to the Company and the intermediary’s customer opens an account and/or otherwise enters into a contractual relationship with one or more of the Bank’s business units, KYC due diligence on the contracting party is the responsibility of the business unit; however, businesses are permitted to rely on the customer identification and verification procedures of another financial institution to establish the identity of the customer.  Reliance, for purposes of such safe harbor, is appropriate when the other financial institution has established a similar banking/business relationship with the customer to that of the Company and when such reliance can be considered reasonable under the circumstances.  In order to be able to rely on the customer identification procedures of another financial institution, the other entity:Must be subject to the AML program requirements set forth in the USA PATRIOT Act and implementing regulationsMust be regulated by a U.S. Federal functional regulator, andMust enter into a contract with the Bank requiring the other financial institution to certify annually that it has implemented its AML program and that it, or its agent, will perform the customer identification and verification program requirements.In instances in which the intermediary to be relied upon is not subject to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act, that intermediary:Must be subject to money laundering control requirements under its local laws and regulationsMust be regulated by a recognizable financial services regulator in the country of jurisdictionMust provide a letter of attestation to the Bank in which its attests to its compliance with all appropriate customer identification, verification, and other due diligence requirements.In all cases in which a business is placing reliance upon an intermediary for the performance of any customer identification or other KYC due diligence steps, the prior, written approval must be obtained from the BSA/AML Compliance Officer.  This approval is required whether the entity relied upon is U.S. or non-U.S. intermediary.KYC information provided by new employees who bring customers with them from other financial institutions must be independently obtained and verified by someone other than the new employee.Ongoing Relationship/Customer/Account ActivitiesKYC records are intended to be dynamic and enhanced over time as knowledge of a customer grows.  The relationship owner will review and update KYC information whenever significant changes in activity, ownership, or public information about the client become known.In order to monitor account activity, on an on-going basis, for unusual activity, the following specific system reports have been selected for review on a daily basis by the Compliance Liaison:High Dollar Cash Item ReportDraws Against Uncollected/Unavailable Funds PDD750-14Balance Changes – Significant Report PDD750-07Also in regards to the ACH environment, the Operations Manager will review the following reports on a daily basis for unusual activity and scanning:Entries – Checking PL6570-01Entries – Savings PL6570-06Originating Entries PL5500-02OFAC Screening – Receiving PL6570-01 (IATs)OFAC Screening – Receiving Final PL6579-02 (IATs)Unusual activity may encompass the following:Reviewing originators/recipients’ whose business or occupation does not warrant the volume or nature of ACH activity;Originators whose origination activity suddenly exceeds projections/credit-debit limits with no reasonable explanation for such change;Originators generating a high rate or high volume of invalid account returns or a high-rate or high volume of unauthorized returns/transactions;Specific returns creations (RDFI) covering unauthorized, fraudulent, or revoked transactions, and Federal reclamations.Unusual conditions will be investigated and handled appropriately by the reviewer.  Such examination of these daily reports must be evidenced by the reviewer by initialing the Daily Account Review Log or the report printout.In order to monitor ongoing wire transfer records quarterly, the branch manager/designee will review the Wire Transfer Velocity Report for questionable and/or unusual patterns.  Particular attention will be paid to incidents where:Unexplained or sudden extensive wire activity, especially in accounts that had little or no previous activity;A large number of wire transfers to or from unrelated third parties inconsistent with the customer’s legitimated business purpose;Wire transfers that have no apparent business purpose to or from a foreign country;The customer’s account has inflows of funds or other assets well beyond the known income or resources of the customer;Transactions in which the primary beneficiary or counter-party is undisclosed. Note:  Because elderly individuals experience declining cognitive or physical abilities, they are more reliant on specific individuals for their physical well-being, financial management, and social interaction.  Therefore, certain elderly individuals may be particularly vulnerable to identity theft, embezzlement, and fraudulent schemes.  See Appendix H for Possible Signs of Elder Financial Exploitation.An investigation will be conducted for any activity deemed suspicious and if necessary, a SAR will be filed.  The branch manager/designee will sign the quarterly report as evidence that the quarterly review was conducted. This Policy provides for a process of periodic, risk-based customer relationship reviews.  In the absence of an event that calls immediate attention to a relationship or to activity in the customer’s accounts, the periodic review provides the Bank with the opportunity to update KYC information, review the customer’s recent transactions and interactions with the Bank, and reaffirm that retaining the relationship continues to be appropriate.The periodic review is to be performed by the relationship owner and should:Ensure that KYC information is accurate, complete, and up-to-dateConsider the effects of any significant inflows, outflows, and any obvious changes in the accounts’ purposes, for appropriateness and consistency with expectations.Evaluate the customers’ general transaction volumes and overall balances across all products and services for reasonableness and consistency with the customer’s financial situation and the relationship’s stated purpose.Periodic reviews will occur at least every 12 months for high-risk customers and 24 for medium-risk customers.  The first month of each quarter, high risk accounts having a yearly anniversary in that quarter, based on the date of the assigned risk rating, will be identified.  During that three-month period, a review will be performed using the Standard Account Review Sheet.  The review method for medium risk accounts would be the same but based upon a two-year anniversary of the assigned risk rating date.  The Standard Account Review Sheet is subject to the necessary review and approval based on established requirements.Refer to Appendix F for Standard Account Review SheetSpecial MeasuresThe USA PATRIOT Act gives the Secretary of the Treasury authority to impose special measures against foreign jurisdictions, foreign financial institutions, transactions involving such jurisdictions or institutions, or one or more types of accounts, that are determined to pose a “primary money laundering concern” to the United States.The BSA/AML Compliance Officer will coordinate compliance with such special measures on a bank-wide basis.  It is the policy of the Bank to promptly comply with any special measures prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.  Whenever the Secretary imposes special measures, Compliance shall communicate the special measures to the affected businesses, which will take the steps necessary to terminate affected account relationships, communicate to customers, and/or amend existing policies, procedures, and controls or develop new ones to comply with the prescribed special measures.Information SharingThe USA PATRIOT Act provides for information sharing between the Government and Financial Institutions, as well as between financial institutions themselves, in an effort to deter money laundering and terrorist activities.Section 314(a) of the Act establishes a mechanism for law enforcement agencies to communicate the names of suspected terrorists and money launderers to covered financial institutions for the purpose of promptly identifying accounts and transactions involving those suspects.  Under 314(a), information requests are batched and forwarded to covered financial institutions from FinCEN every two weeks (although single requests may be sent in urgent situations).Upon receipt of a 314(a) request, Company covered financial institutions are required to search the following records:Deposit account recordsFunds transfer recordsRecords for the sale of monetary instrumentsLoan recordsThe Bank will search its records for the preceding 12 months for accounts, and for the preceding 6 months for transactions, and report them to FinCEN.  If other matching records are found in this process, they will also be reported to FinCEN, even if they fall outside of the requested time frame, or pertain to an account or transaction in an area of the financial institution that was not required to be searched but were searched anyway, or pertain to a record that was not required to be maintained under federal law or regulation but existed nonetheless.Searches are required to be completed and a response to be sent to FinCEN with any matches within two weeks of receiving the 314(a) request.If there is a positive match for an account or a transaction, the following information will be gathered:The identity of the individual, entity, or organizationThe account number(s); opening date, type of transactionsAll identifying information provided by the account holder in connection with the opening of the account, such as social security number, taxpayer identification number, passport information, date of birth, and address.Names are highly confidential and should be shared only on a limited basis.  Under no circumstances should 314(a) names be shared with any other financial institution.  Records regarding 314(a) searches must be retained in a secure area.If the 314(a) search results in a positive match, it is incumbent upon the Bank to conduct an investigation of the account relationship and/or transaction activity and should there be reasonable belief that suspicious activity occurred, an Incident Report must be drafted for SAR consideration.  If the Bank decides to close the account, it will first notify the law enforcement contact on the request to determine if closing the account would interfere with an active investigation.  If law enforcement requests that an account remain open, the bank will request written confirmation.Note:  The bank does not participate in 314(b)Refer to Appendix G for procedures concerning responses to information requests Subpoenas Received from Law EnforcementThe receipt of a grand jury subpoena will cause the bank to conduct a risk assessment and account relationship review of the subject customer.  The information resulting from the review, transactions, and accounts subject to the subpoena will be evaluated and a determination will be made as to whether additional account monitoring should be implemented or a suspicious activity report filed.Currency Transaction Reporting and ExemptionsIn compliance with the BSA regulations, the following types of reports are submitted to the U.S. government:FinCEN Form 104, Currency Transaction Report (CTR):  A CTR must be filed for each deposit, withdrawal, exchange of currency, or other payment or transfer, by, through or to a financial institution, which involves a transaction in currency of more than $10,000.  Multiple currency transactions must be treated as a single transaction if the financial institution has knowledge that:  (a) they are conducted by or on behalf of the same person; and, (b) they result in cash received or disbursed by the financial institution of more than $10,000.  A CTR must be filed within 15 days paperless or 25 days on magnetic tape following the date of reportable transaction with the Internal Revenue Service.  The bank must retain copies of CTRs for five years from the date of the report.FinCEN Form 105, Report of International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments (CMIR):  Each person who physically transports, mails or ships, or causes to be physically transported, mailed, shipped or received, currency, traveler’s checks, and certain other monetary instruments in an aggregate amount exceeding $10,000 into or out of the United States must file a CMIR.Note:  The Bank will not grant customer Exemptions at this time.Currency transactions over $3,000 are recorded daily on the “Currency Transactions Greater Than $3,000 Log”.  Daily, this log is reviewed by the Compliance Liaison to ensure that multiple currency transactions totaling over $10,000 for a customer are properly reported.  This log also must be reviewed for possible structuring situations and initialed as evidence of review.  On a monthly basis, the branch manager/designnee will review this report on a cumulative basis to detect patterns or structuring trends.  The branch manager/designee will evidence this review by signing this monthly report. Structuring is the breaking up of transactions for the purpose of evading the BSA reporting and recordkeeping requirements and, if appropriate thresholds are met, should be reported as a suspicious transaction.  Structuring may be indicative of underlying illegal activity; further, structuring itself is unlawful under the BSA.Penalties and asset forfeiture for money laundering can be severe under BSA:Individuals, including employees of financial institutions, convicted of money laundering face up to 20 years in prison for each money-laundering transaction.Businesses, including banks and individuals, face fines up to $1,000,000 or twice the value of the transaction, whichever is greater.Financial Institutions can lose their charter/license, and employees risk being removed and barred from the business.Any property involved in the transaction or traceable to the proceeds of the criminal activity, including loan collateral, personal property and, under certain conditions, entire bank accounts (even if some of the money in the account is legitimate) may be subject to forfeiture. Safe Harbor Provision The Annunzio Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act (1992) – U.S.C. 5318(g)(3) - provides a safe harbor for the bank and its employee from civil liability for reporting known or suspected criminal offenses or suspicious activity by filing a SAR. A bank employee should feel safe in reporting suspicious activity.  The government works closely with the bank to ensure that all employees are protected from any liability.  Federal Law prohibits Employees from disclosing the fact that a SAR has been filed.  Never discuss any Suspicious Activity Reporting requirements with a customer. Voluntarily giving additional information to customers, such as when you completed an incident report for their suspicious activity makes the employee liable for prosecution for violating Anti-Money Laundering Laws.Recordkeeping and Record Retention RequirementsThe following rules apply to CIP-related records:Identifying information (name, address, date of birth, and government-issued ID number) must be retained for five years after the date the account is closedAll other information and documentation required by CIP rules, such as other recorded customer information, copies of documents used to verify identity, records of the steps taken and the results of verification performed by non-documentary means, and the resolution of discrepancies that may have arisen between information provided by a customer and the documentary and non-documentary evidence used to verify such information, must be retained for five years after the record is made.KYC-related records can be maintained in either hard copy or in electronic form, so long as the records are accurate and readily accessible within five calendar days.The Bank must maintain a record of each funds transfer of $3,000 or more, which it originates, acts as an intermediary for, or receives for five years.  The amount and type of information that must be recorded and kept depends upon the Bank’s role in the funds transfer process.  Also, the Bank must pass certain information along to the next bank in the funds transfer chain when it acts as an originator or intermediary for a funds transfer.Transmitter’s Financial InstitutionIntermediary Financial InstitutionName and account number of the transmitterAll of the information included in the payment order by the transmitter’s financial institution, plus;Address of the transmitterName and address or numerical identifier of the transmitter’s financial institutionIdentity of the transmitter’s financial institutionAmount of the transmittalExecution date of the transmittal orderIdentity of the recipients financial institutionAnd as many of the following items as are received with the transmittal:Name and address of the recipientAccount number of the recipientOther specific identifiers of the recipientThe Bank which provides for the purchase and sale of monetary instruments must require the retention of records of cash sale to a customer for bank checks, drafts, cashier’s checks, money orders, and traveler’s checks (which the Bank does not currently sell) between $3,000 and $10,000 inclusive for five years.  These records must include evidence of verification of the identity of the purchaser and other information as outlined below:The name of the purchaser;Date of purchase;Types of instrument purchased;Serial number of the instrument purchased; The amounts in dollars of each of the instruments purchased; andVerification that the individual is a deposit holder/verification or the purchaser’s identity (address, SS#/Alien Identification #, DOB).The following records will be retained for seven years:A record of each extension of credit in an amount in excess of $10,000Each document granting signature authority over each deposit or share accountEach statement, ledger card or other record on each deposit or share account, showing each transaction in, or with respect to, that accountEach check, clean draft, or money order drawn on the Company or issued and payable by itEach item in excess of $100 comprising a debit to a customer’s deposit or share accountRecords prepared or received in the ordinary course of business, which would be needed to reconstruct a transaction account and to trace a check in excess of $100Each deposit slip or credit ticket reflecting a transaction in excess of $100.AML TrainingTwice a year, the Bank shall maintain a regular training program for the purpose of educating its personnel and heightening their awareness so that they will be knowledgeable and vigilant in their efforts to recognize and report activity, which may constitute money laundering.Within 30 days of hire, new employees will be trained in the basic aspect of AML.  Additionally the new employee will be required to read and attest that they understand the contents of the Bank’s AML/BSA policies.Note:  Training will be conducted at least annually for the Board of Directors.BSA/AML Compliance OfficerThe BSA/AML Compliance Officer has day-to-day responsibility for managing all aspects of the Bank’s AML Program and compliance with AML laws and regulations.  The BSA/AML Compliance Officer is also responsible for the maintenance of this Policy and for considering deviations to this Policy.  In addition, the BSA/AML Compliance Officer advises staff regarding the application of anti-money laundering laws and regulations and on money laundering trends and patterns specific to certain businesses.BSA/AML Risk AssessmentThe Bank has developed a risk assessment, which was approved by the Board of Directors, by identifying risks along with the associated mitigants.  The assessment will be periodically reviewed and presented to the Board for approval.Independent TestingIndependent testing commensurate with the BSA/AML risk profile of the bank will be conducted every 12 to 18 months by outside auditors.  Upon completion, the auditors conducting the BSA/AML test will report the results to the Audit Committee.APPENDIX AEXAMPLES OF SUSPICIOUS CONDUCT AND TRANSACTIONSThe existence of one or more of these suspicious circumstances does not mean that money laundering activity is taking place, but that such circumstances should be scrutinized carefully.Customers who are reluctant to provide normal information when opening an account or who provide fictitious or conflicting information.Customers with no discernible reason for using the Bank’s services (e.g. customers with distant addresses who could find the same services nearer to home)Business customers who are reluctant to provide complete information regarding the purpose, prior banking relationships, officers or directors, or location of their business.Business customers who are reluctant to reveal details about their activities, or to provide financial statements, or whose financial statements are noticeably different from those of similar businesses.Large cash deposits by an individual or business where checks and other instruments are the expected norm.Structuring multiple cash deposits which are individually unexceptional, but significant in the aggregate.Exchanging large quantities of low denomination currencies for those of higher denomination.Deposit or withdrawal activity that is inconsistent with the activity normally associated with the customer or the customer’s type of business.Funds transfers are sent or received from the same person to or from different accounts.Funds activity is unexplained, repetitive, or shows unusual patterns.A customer uses unusual or suspicious identification documents that cannot be readily verified.The customer’s background differs from that which would be expected on the basis of his or her business activities.A customer is reluctant to provide information needed to file a mandatory report, to have the report filed, or to proceed with a transaction after being informed that the report must be filed.A person uses the automated teller machine to make several bank deposits below a specified threshold.The currency transaction activity reflect a sudden change inconsistent with normal activities.A customer purchases a number of cashier’s checks, money orders, or traveler’s checks for large amounts under a specified threshold.Suspicious movements of funds occur from one bank to another and then funds are moved back to the first bank.Deposits of large third-party checks endorsed in favor of the customer where such conduct is inconsistent with the customer’s normal activity.Large numbers of individuals making payments into the same account without adequate explanation.Unexpected repayment of problem loans.Requests to provide or arrange financing where the source of the customer’s financial contribution to a deal is unclear, particularly where property is involved.Employees whose habits or lifestyles change unexpectedlyEmployees whose performance changes unexpectedly.The stated occupation of the customer is not commensurate with the type of level of activity.Regarding nonprofit or charitable organizations, financial transactions occur for which there appears to be no logical economic purpose or in which there appears to be no link between the stated activity of the organization and the other parties in the transaction.For additional examples of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing “Red Flags” see the FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual 4/29/2010.APPENDIX BCOUNTRY TIERING LISTTier

FinCEN posts on its secure website a list of individuals, entities and organizations which are under investigation by one or more federal agencies.  All financial institutions covered by 314(a) of the USA Patriot Act are required to quickly search their records to determine whether they maintain or have engaged in transactions with any of the named subjects.If the Bank finds a match with a subject named on FinCEN’s 314(a) list, the match must be reported to FinCEN by making an entry on FinCEN’s secure website no later than fourteen (14) calendar days after the list was posted.  At that point, a federal agency may follow up with a subpoena for specified documents.  That subpoena is processed like any other subpoena from law enforcement.  If the Bank has no match, no response is necessary.A search of all pertinent Bank systems that contain customer information to determine whether or not the Company has any “hits” for the names listed on the request.  The appropriate affirmative responses are entered on the FinCEN secure website.Also the pertinent account or transactional activity is analyzed, and if the filing of a SAR is warranted, a SAR is prepared and filed.All Bank employees involved in the processing and handling of 314(a) requests are required to keep the information confidential.  The fact that a 314(a) request has been made, or that responsive information has been found, may not be shared with anyone outside of the Bank, with the exception of FinCEN and appropriate law enforcement officers.  Moreover, the 314(a) requests and any supporting documentation must be maintained in secure files.Note:  See detailed procedures regarding the process of down/up loading of files for filtering.

It also identifies a set of money laundering risk ratings, and includes standards for performing account surveillance, and maintaining records.Non-compliance with the requirements of this policy could seriously undermine the reputation of and public confidence in the Bank and could result in disciplinary actions against the Bank and its employees, including civil and criminal penalties and other sanctions.The U.S. Congress enacted the Bank Secrecy Act in October 1970 to prevent banks and other financial service providers from being used as intermediaries to hide the transfer or deposit of money derived from criminal activity.  Since its passage, Congress has amended the BSA a number of times to enhance law enforcement effectiveness.  The reporting and recordkeeping requirements of the BSA regulations create a paper trail for law enforcement to investigate money laundering schemes and other illegal activities.  This paper trail operates to deter illegal activity and provides a means to trace movements of money through the financial system.The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (USA PATRIOT Act) was signed into law by President Bush on October 26, 2001, and contains strong measures to prevent, detect, and prosecute terrorist financing and international money laundering.  Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act is the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001.  It includes provisions for fighting international money laundering and blocking terrorist access to the U.S. financial systems.  ObjectivesThe primary objective of this Policy is to help protect the good name and reputation of the Bank, and to secure its premises and systems against misuse as a vehicle for money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illegal activities.  Specific objectives include the following:To ensure compliance with applicable U.S. and local anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing laws and regulations while protecting the financial privacy and relationship between the Bank and its customersTo establish minimum standards needed to determine and verify the identity of new customers and any other relevant account parties, and to require the application of enhanced due diligence standards to those customers considered higher-risk as a matter of law or regulations, or based upon the Bank’s own assessment of riskTo set appropriate standards for the ongoing conduct of customer relationshipsTo institute sound account/transaction surveillance standards as a mechanism for enabling Bank personnel to recognize, detect, and report money laundering, terrorist financing, and/or suspicious activity occurring through Bank accountsTo delineate the responsibilities of employees who implement the Bank’s AML processes.PolicyThe Bank will comply with the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), the USA PATRIOT Act, and other applicable AML laws and regulations.  Also the Bank, consistent with applicable law, cooperates with governmental and law enforcement authorities in the enforcement of AML laws and regulations in connection with transactions involving the Bank.No director, officer or employee of the Company shall:Knowingly engage in, or assist any other person or entity in engaging in, any activity believed by such director, officer or employee to involve money laundering, terrorist financing or other suspicious or criminal activityAssist any customer in structuring financial transactions in order to avoid disclosure to governmental or law enforcement authorities under applicable lawAdvise any customer that their information has been, or will be, reported to governmental or law enforcement authorities (unless informing the customer is permissible, such as during the preparation of a Currency Transaction Report)Make a conscious decision to avoid learning the truth about a customer’s suspected illegal activities.Any director, officer or employee of the Company who fails to adhere to any of the foregoing policies may be subject to immediate demotion, reassignment or dismissal, and such failure may cause such individual and the Bank to be subject to severe civil and/or criminal penalties.Money Laundering and Terrorist FinancingMoney Laundering is the involvement in any one transaction, or series of transactions, which assists a person in keeping, concealing or disposing of the proceeds derived from illegal activities.  It is the criminal act of processing “dirty” money, through a series of transactions; in this way the funds are “cleaned” so that they appear to be proceeds from legal activities.  Refer to Appendix A for examples of suspicious conduct and transactions related to money launderingAlthough money laundering is a complex process, it basically involves the following three steps that can occur independently or simultaneously:The first stage of laundering money is placement.  The goal is to introduce the unlawful proceeds into the financial system without attracting the attention of financial institutions or law enforcement.  Placement techniques include structuring currency deposits in an amount to evade reporting requirements or commingling currency deposits of legal and illegal enterprises.  An example may include dividing large amounts of currency such as purchasing a series of monetary instruments.The second stage of the money laundering process is layering, which involves moving funds around the financial system, often in a complex series of transactions, to create confusion.  Examples of layering include wiring funds to and through numerous accounts at many institutions.The final stage of the process is integration.  Once the funds are in the financial system and obstructed through the layering stage, the integration stage is used to further create the appearance of legal funds through additional transactions.  Examples include the real estate transactions or investment securities.Terrorists generally finance their activities through both unlawful and legitimate sources.  Unlawful activities, such as extortion, kidnapping, and drug trafficking, have been found to be a major source of funding.  Other observed activities include improper use of charitable or relief funds that donors may have no knowledge that their donations have been diverted to support terrorist causes.  Other legitimate sources have also been found to provide terrorist organizations with funding; these legitimate sources are a key difference between terrorist financiers and traditional criminal organizations.Prohibited CountriesThe Bank may determine that it will not process transactions involving certain countries, or maintain or open new accounts for clients located in certain countries, because of publicly reported concerns of law enforcement agencies and regulators with respect to money laundering controls in those countries.  As events change, the Bank may add or delete countries from this prohibition.Refer to Appendix B for Countries Tiering List         .Know Your Customer StandardsSound business practices include the concept of knowing your customer.  Observing the standards within this Policy can greatly reduce the risk that the Bank might be used for unlawful purposes.  A sound Know Your Customer Policy include, at a minimum:Establishing the true identity of the customer and other related parties to the account, as appropriateScreening customer and, as appropriate, related party names against government listsObtaining additional information/documentation as needed to understand the customer’s level of risk, determine the need for enhanced due diligence, and enable the detection of suspicious activityDetermining the customer source of fundsUnderstanding and recording the account’s purpose and anticipated transaction behaviorMaintaining up-to-date knowledge of the customer through ongoing client contact and periodic reviews.Prohibited CustomersThe Bank intends to do business with reputable customers whose identity can be verified.  The Bank will not knowingly do business with persons or entities with whom the Bank is prohibited from doing business because they are sanctioned under the U.S. Embargo Programs or any other official government lists that are identified and distributed throughout the Bank or are applicable in the local jurisdiction.  Also those with whom the Company has chosen not to do business based on prior experience.  In addition, Shell Banks which is one that does not have a physical presence in any country.  Physical presence is defined as a place of business that (1) is maintained by a non-U.S. bank; (2) is located at a fixed address in a country in which the non-U.S. bank is authorized to conduct banking activities, at which location the non-U.S. bank employs one or more individuals on a full-time basis and maintains operating records related to its banking activities; and (3) is subject to inspection by the banking authority that licensed the non-U.S. bank to conduct banking activities.Also, the Bank will not knowingly do business with individuals or entities:Whose character or financial conduct are suspect at the inception of the relationship or becomes suspect at any time during the relationshipConvicted of money laundering or related financial crimeWho attempt to establish anonymous accounts, accounts in obviously fictitious names or accounts where the identity of the true beneficial owner of the funds is required but cannot be obtainedWho refuse to provide information required by the BankCustomer Identification Program (CIP)Minimum identifying information must be obtained, recorded and verified for any new customer prior to opening their first account or providing their first product/service.  For the purpose of CIP requirements, a customer is defined as any person, including both individuals and entities (e.g., corporations, partnerships and trusts), that opens a new account, product or service, including deposit, transaction, asset, securities, safekeeping, collateral, or mutual fund accounts, credit, lending or borrowing activities, a safe deposit box, or cash management, custody, trust or estate services.  Typically, the customer is the accountholder.  In cases where an individual opens an account on behalf of a person who lacks legal capacity, such as a minor or an entity that is not a legal person, the individual opening the account is the customer.  The following entities are excluded from the definition of customer for CIP purposes:Financial institutions regulated by a U.S. Federal functional regulator or banks regulated by a U.S. state bank regulatorDepartments or agencies of the U.S., including any state or political subdivision of any stateEntities established under the laws of the U.S., state laws, political subdivision of any state, or under an interstate compact, that exercise governmental authority on behalf of the U.S., or any such State or political subdivisionPublicly listed entities whose common stock or similar equity interests are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, or the NASDAQ Stock Market.For new customers who are individuals, including joint accountholders, the following identification information must be obtained and recorded:NameDate of birthPrimary residence address (and mailing address, if different from residence address).  For a customer who does not have a residential or mailing address, a business street address, an Army Post Office or Fleet Post Office box number or the residential or business address of next of kin or of another contact individualGovernment issued identification number – For U.S. individuals, this number must be the Social Security Number.  For non-U.S. individuals/foreign based individuals, the number can be a taxpayer identification number, passport number, national identification number, resident’s identification number, alien identification number, or another government-issued identification number.For new customers who are entities, the following identification information must be obtained and recorded:Legal namePrincipal place of business address (or local office address)Government issued identification number – For U.S. entities (established or organized in the U.S.), this number must be the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN/Employer Identification Number (EIN).  For non-U.S. entities/foreign based individuals, this number can be a taxpayer identification number, registration number, or another government-issued identification number.  Alternative government-issued documentation that certifies existence must be requested for any non-U.S. entities that do not have an identification number.There may be instances (i.e., a newly formed entity) when the customer has applied for the TIN/EIN, but it has not been received at the time the account is requested.  In all cases, the TIN/EIN must be obtained by the Bank within 60 days or the account must be closed.  The Bank will track accounts opened without TINs/EINs, and may consider restricting account usage, such as limiting deposits, withdrawals, check writing, extension of credit or other measures while receipt of the TIN/EIN is pending.The identification of each customer is typically verified before or at account opening.  For all businesses, verification must be accomplished no later than 30 days after account opening.  Identity verification can be accomplished through documentary or non-documentary means or a combination of both.  Depending on the risks associated with the customer, businesses may consider whether to restrict the customer’s activities until such time that the verification has been completed.Documentary verification is accomplished by obtaining, reviewing, and making a record of one acceptable form of identification document.  For individual customers, acceptable identification documents include unexpired, government-issued photo IDs, such as:PassportDriver’s license or non-driver photo ID cardMilitary ID cardFor businesses/entities, acceptable identification documents include:Certificate of Incorporation/Filing ReceiptGeneral or Limited Partnership AgreementArticles of Organization or Association/Certification of FormationTrust InstrumentLetters of Trusteeship or ExecutorshipU.S. Internal Revenue Code Sec. 501(c)(3) letter (for nonprofit organizations)A government-issued business licenseFor foreign based entities, those legal documents issued by other countries that parallel the above and authenticate the entity will be accepted upon verification.These documents are to be used to confirm the accuracy of the information provided by new customers.  A record of the document(s) used must be retained on file and should include:  a description (i.e., the type of document), its identification number, the place of issuance, the date of issuance, and the expiration date (as applicable).  A photocopy of the document (should the business choose to make and retain photocopies) will satisfy this requirement. Refer to Appendix C for further description of documentary verification documents         The Bank may choose to perform non-documentary verification in addition to, or instead of, placing reliance on the documents named above.  Non-documentary verification may include, but is not limited to:Contacting the customer at home after the relationship has been establishedObtaining references from reliable sources (e.g., credit bureaus, other financial institutions)Performing a site visit at the entity customer’s place of business.Even when not required, non-documentary verification may be considered an additional safeguard, particularly in higher-risk businesses and with high-risk customers.  When non-documentary verification is used, a record must be made and retained of the methods undertaken to verify the identity of a customer; this record should include a description of the methods and the results of verification performed.During the course of verifying the identity of a customer, discrepancies may arise between the information obtained from the customer and the information obtained during the verification.  Resolutions resulting in the continuing the relationship need to be further documented and approved by a Vice President or above.Bank employees are under no obligation to continue the customer identification and verification process if, at any time during this process, they determine that it is in the best interest of the Bank to terminate the relationship or discontinue the customer acceptance process.  If the decision to discontinue customer acceptance is based on a CIP failure and is deemed suspicious, an Incident Report Form must be filed even though accounts are not opened.The USA PATRIOT Act requires that, prior to opening an account that the Bank notify its customers that it will be requesting information to verify their identity.  The Bank’s signage/brochure will include the following language:Important Information About Procedures For Opening a New AccountTo help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, financial institutions are required by Federal law to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each individual or entity that opens an account or requests credit.What this means for individuals:  When an individual opens an account or requests credit, we will ask for their name, residence address, date of birth, tax identification number, and other information that allows us to identify them.  We may also ask to see a driver’s license, passport or other identifying documents.New Account ReviewWithin five business days, the branch manager or designee will review new account information and supporting documentation to determine whether all the necessary information was obtained, the account appears suspicious in any manner, the risk rating is proper and the type of account/business/customer is in compliance with bank policy.  Also as part of this review, the branch manager or designee validates the information on the Insight system to ensure accuracy.  The branch manager or designee signs the “Account Opening Data Entry Form” as evidence of the review and approval.OFAC Screening/Comparison with Government ListsUpon opening an account, the related party names are screened against the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanction list.  Upon receipt of an update of the OFAC sanction list, the entire portfolio is scanned against this sanction list.  Possible matches are investigated and any true matches are escalated to the OFAC Compliance Officer for resolution.The new account will also be scanned to determine whether the customer appears on any list, should one be issued, of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations issued by any Federal government agency and designated as such by Treasury in consultation with the Federal functional regulators.  Possible matches are investigated and any true matches are escalated to the BSA/AML Compliance Officer.  The BSA/AML Compliance Officer is responsible to ensure that all federal directives issued in connection with these lists are followed.KYC Due Diligence RequirementsKYC due diligence must be performed on all new customers at the time the relationship with the Bank is first established.  For the purposes of KYC, the customer is each person in whose name an account is opened or a product/service is initiated.  This person can be an individual, a company, an organization or other entity.  The Bank will obtain information and perform due diligence on related parties where appropriate.  Related parties include persons who have authority, or who are in a position of control, over the account, product or service, as well as the beneficial owner(s) of the assets and persons who are intended to receive a benefit from, or be a recipient under, the relationship.  The following are some examples of related parties:The account’s nominal and/or beneficial owner(s)For an account in the name of an agent, the principalFor a company account, the significant owners, principal officers, key senior managers, and directors of the companyFor an account in the name of a trust, the donor, trustees, and executors.When opening a new account for an existing customer, it is not necessary to re-perform customer identification/verification steps provided that the existing customer information is current and complete and the Bank maintains the reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of the customer.  Additional account level data, however, may be needed in certain circumstances relative to any additional accounts offered to existing customers.  Similar account level data may also be necessary when a new account is opened for a new customer.  Depending on the type of account, such additional information may include, but is not limited to:Type and purpose of accountSource of initial and ongoing fundingAnticipated activity:  the anticipated usage, activity, types of transactions, volumes and dollar amountsBeneficial Ownership Rule:CRB staff is required to identify the beneficial owners of their legal entity customers-including corporations, limited liability companies, partnerships, business trusts, any other entity created by a filing with a state office, any similar entities formed under the laws of a non-US jurisdiction and similar entities-that open new accounts. The definition of “legal entity customer” does not include:Natural personsSole ProprietorshipsUnincorporated Associations (i.e. Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, neighborhood associations)Trusts, other than statutory trusts created by a filing with a state officeSpecifically, CRB must identify and verify Beneficial owners defined as: one or more natural persons, if any, who directly or indirectly own 25% or more of a legal entity customer, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, and; a natural person who "controls" the entity with significant responsibility to control, manage, or direct a legal entity customer, including:An executive officer or senior manager (e.g., a Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Managing Member, General Partner, President, Vice President, or Treasurer); or any other individual who regularly performs similar functions.Certain legal entities, including the following, are excluded from the Beneficial Ownership Rule:Domestic banks in the United States (including domestic offices of foreign banks);Entities listed on the New York, American, or NASDAQ stock exchanges;Majority-owned subsidiaries of such listed entities;Security issuers registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;Investment companies;SEC- and CFTC- registered entities;Bank holding companies;Pooled investment vehicles operated by an entity that is not a legal entity customer;State-regulated insurance companies;Designated financial market utilities;Foreign financial institutions whose regulator maintains beneficial ownership information;Foreign government entities that do not engage in commercial activities; andLegal entities only to the extent that they open a private bank accountInternal Account Requests:  The following policies apply when a bank employee submits an account opening request to the branch manager.The person submitting the form (i.e. the person signing the “Requested by” field) to the branch manager will be the Relationship Owner of the account.The Relationship Owner will be responsible for completing the following:Gathering and ensuring that all information is complete to support the opening of the account;Determining the money laundering risk ratingAny updating of Know Your Customer (KYC) information.  The Relationship Owner updates the KYC information, when there is a significant change in customer activity (for example new products added, or increase in transaction volume), ownership, or public information about the customer.  Completing the periodic review - For high risk customers, the periodic review occurs one per year, whereas for medium risk customers, the periodic review occurs once every two years (based on the date the account was opened).  Conducting site visits of high risk customers, in case there is a triggering event.  Triggering events include:  negative news; unusual increase/decrease in account activity; changes in the nature of the account activity; money laundering alerts that cannot be cleared; word of mouth tips; or reluctance from customer to provide information.  Refer to Appendix D for a sample of the Internal New Account Request formMoney Laundering Risk RatingsMoney laundering risk ratings are an evaluation of the customer’s/account’s potential money laundering risk.  As such, they can impact the approvals needed to accept a customer or open the account, determine the extent of information and verification required, trigger the need for enhanced due diligence, and affect the frequency of periodic relationship reviews.The relationship owner determines the money laundering risk rating but will be reviewed by another individual.  Money laundering risk ratings must be determined before a new customer is accepted, and at, or immediately after, a new account is opened.  They are to be re-evaluated and adjusted, as appropriate, during the periodic review process, or at any other time when the business learns of new information that affects the rating.  The branch manager is responsible for reviewing or approving changes to a client’s risk rating.Money laundering risk ratings apply at both the customer and account level.  If a customer is high-risk by himself, because for example he is a politically exposed person or associated with a high-risk industry, then all of his accounts should be classified as high-risk.  If an account is rated high-risk, however, the associated customer is not automatically high-risk.Risk determination is a two-part process.  First, the relationship owner must identify and understand the general operating and overall legal, regulatory and geopolitical environments in which their customers operate.  Second, the relationship owner must, at a minimum, understand the following to determine whether they want to enter into, or sustain, a relationship with a particular customer within their target market:The nature of the customer, including their reputation and business or other financial activitiesThe products and services requested, and the customer’s purpose for and use of such products and servicesThe money laundering risks associated with the customer and the jurisdiction(s) with which the customer has significant contact.Also the following risk factors will be considered:Customer-Type – At a minimum, the following customers shall be considered high-risk:  Politically Exposed Persons, Money Services Businesses, Offshore International Business Corporations and Private Investment Companies, any customers associated with substantial negative public information.Geography – At a minimum, customers associated with (i.e., located/domiciled in, a citizen or resident of, and/or has business activities in) a Tier 1 country shall be considered high-risk.  Refer to Appendix B for the Country Tiering ListIndustry – At a minimum, customers associated with (i.e., one is principally engaged in or whose source of wealth was generated from) a high-risk industry shall be considered high-risk.  Refer to Appendix E for the High- and Medium-Risk Industries ListProducts and Services – At a minimum, customers and/or accounts that use high-risk products or services shall be considered high-risk.  Refer to Appendix F for the Medium Risk Products ListTransaction Activity – Such as whether the customer’s expected transaction activity, including cash and/or wire activity, is determined to be high.Money Laundering Risk Ratings for New Online Accounts[Insert Financial Institution Here] recognizes that accounts which are opened without face-to-face or phone contact may pose a higher risk for money laundering for the following reasons:More difficult to positively verify the individual’s identity;Customer may be out of [Insert Financial Institution Here]’s targeted geographic area;Customer may perceive the transactions as less transparent;Transactions are instantaneous; and/orMay be used by a “front” company or unknown third party.The Bank will obtain the same information as it would for a face-to-face account opening and will use ChexSystems’ QualiFile electronic inquiry response to authenticate identity.  The Bank has limited the geographic availability to New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.  Due to the above considerations, all new online accounts will be deemed medium risk for the first three (3) months and if there is no unusual activity for that time period, then the account will be changed to low risk.  Pursuant to the Bank’s two (2) year periodic review process for medium risk accounts, if the customer’s activity warrants a change in risk rating, then the Bank will act accordingly.  Please refer to the Bank’s Account Create Procedures. Additional KYC Due Diligence Requirements for Certain Customers, Related Parties, and AccountsNew High-Risk CustomersAll new customer relationships that are deemed high-risk, and those escalated from medium or low to high-risk, are subject to review by the AML Officer.  The Standard Account Review Sheet is subject to completion, and review based on established requirements.  If, upon review, the AML officer deems that the Bank cannot continue with this relationship, the AML officer will make a recommendation to close the account.  Any decision to keep the account open after such recommendation will require approval from the Chairman of the Board.Refer to Appendix G for Standard Account Review SheetPolitically Exposed PersonsCustomers/related parties who are Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) increase the risk that the Bank could be exposed to involvement in money laundering or other illegal activities.  The financial activities of PEPs may be of public interest or might otherwise attract publicity within or beyond the borders of their home country, and their transactions with the Bank could potentially involve the proceeds of foreign official corruption.  If the Bank knowingly engages in financial transactions in violation of the money laundering laws of various jurisdictions, the Company will be exposed to significant legal and reputational harm.PEPs are defined as a U.S. or non-U.S., current or former, senior official of the executive, legislative, administrative, military or judicial branches of a government, whether elected or not and include senior officials of a major political party or a senior executive of a government-owned commercial enterprise.  A senior official or executive is defined as an individual with substantial authority over policy, operations, or the use of government owned services.  PEP positions include, but are not limited to:Heads of State, Government Heads or National Leaders, such as the President, Prime Minister, King, Queen, Emir, Sultan, Emperor, Monarch, PopeNational Cabinet Members and Department/Agency Heads, such as the Vice President, Chancellor, Secretary of State, Defense Minister, Chief of the Treasury, Head of the National Bank, and other key Department, Agency, Ministry, and Office OfficialsKey National Legislative Officials, such as Congressmen, Senators, House Representatives, Parliament members, Assemblymen, CouncilmenSenior Military Leaders, such as the Army SecretaryImportant National Justices, such as the Attorney General, Chief Justices, and Associate JudgesPolitical Party LeadersAmbassadors/Consuls General, including the United Nation RepresentativeGovernorsMayors of cities with populations in excess of 1MMSenior executives of government-owned enterprises, such as the Chairman, CEO and President of government airline.The following customers/related parties are also PEPs and are therefore bound by the requirements of this section:Corporations, businesses or entities formed by, or for the benefit of, or significantly owned or controlled by, a PEP; significant ownership is 25% or more; control includes holding a senior executive position of influence, such as the Chairman, CEO, and PresidentAny immediate family member of a PEP, including the spouse, parents, siblings, children, and spouses’ parents or siblingsA person who is widely and publicly known to be a close associate of any such individualForeign Embassies/Consulates/MinistriesForeign political organizations.Upon account opening, reasonable steps will be taken to determine whether customers and related parties are PEPs including the direct inquiry with the customer.  The customer’s KYC profile and account record must indicate that the client is a PEP.Enhanced scrutiny is required whenever the Bank does business with a PEP.  This enhanced scrutiny includes the following:Determining the identity of the PEPAssessing the level of corruption and characteristics associated with the PEP’s countryEvaluating the PEP’s position, length of time in office, and reputationProbing the PEP’s employment history and source of funds and wealthObtaining information on immediate family members or close associates having transaction authority over the accountUnderstanding the purpose of the account and expected volumes and nature of account activityConsidering the use of the account(s)Performing appropriate database/internet checks to gather informationObtaining Board of Directors approval before account opening (presentation to outline the nature of the request, explanation of the rationale for initiating or maintaining the PEP relationship and providing adequate information regarding the PEP, the due diligence steps taken in regard to the relationship and how the PEP’s ongoing activities with Bank will be monitored.)On an annual basis, each Business Head must review the PEPs in his or her business to determine if their retention continues to be appropriate.  This review must be evidenced in writing. Refer to “PEP Scanning Procedures” for detailed processes for identifying Politically Exposed Persons.Money Services BusinessesMoney Service Businesses (MSBs) are high-risk because many:Lack ongoing customer relationships and require minimal or no identification of customersMaintain limited or inconsistent recordkeeping on customers and transactionsEngage in frequent currency transactionsAre subject to varying levels of regulatory requirements and oversightCan quickly change their product mix or location and quickly enter or exit an operationSometimes operate with improper registration or licensingMSBs are defined as any person doing business, whether or not on a regular basis or as an organized business concern, in one or more of the following capacities:Currency dealer or exchangerCheck casher, including “payday” loan and check cashing servicesIssuer of traveler’s checks, money orders or stored value productsSeller or redeemer of traveler’s checks, money orders or stored value products (including the United States Postal Service)Money transmitterIt is the policy of the Bank not to do business with MSBs, except for:U.S. or state-regulated mortgage banking firmsRecognized national or regional retail chain stores whose principal business is not money services.For any other MSBs, Board of Directors approval is required.  In addition, the following baseline due diligence must be performed for all MSB relationships:Confirm that the MSB is registered with FinCENConfirm state and local licensing, if applicableConfirm agent status, if applicableConduct an on-site visitDetermine and review the ownership or senior management of the MSB.Conducting a risk assessment of the MSBConfirmation of MSB’s understanding that it will be subject to federal and state bank regulatory oversight in connection with activities conducted with and through CRBDetermining whether necessary insurance coverage, continuity plans, policies and procedures are in placeIdentifying the MSB’s customers’ profile, potential issues, risks and concerns, and areas of customer complaintsDetermining whether any conflicts of interest exist between management and insiders of CRB; Developing an MSB questionnaire to obtain additional information about each customer’s business. The questionnaire will ask the customer for information on its products and services, customer base, types of software used, employee training procedures, and other information; and Requesting copies of the MSB’s BSA/AML and OFAC policies and procedures. IT due diligence (depending on customer’s business model)As part of its ongoing due diligence, the Bank will conduct periodic site visits of MSB customers.  In addition, MSB customers are required to periodically furnish the bank with: updated, board approved policies and procedures; and independent review of the BSA/AML program and management response.  Refer to the “MSB White Paper” for details regarding MSB due diligence.Hedge FundsHedge funds may be higher-risk because they provide customers with offshore investment vehicles.  Hedge funds are similar to mutual funds in that they both are pooled investment vehicles that accept investors’ money and generally invest it on a collective basis.  Hedge funds differ significantly from mutual funds, however, because hedge funds are not regulated.Before opening an account for a hedge fund, the following due diligence will be performed:Obtain and review a prospectus, offering document or other documentation describing the fundRecord the name of and background information for the investment advisor/management company and/or the general partners or other similar senior officers, such as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Chief Information Officer, etc.Perform OFAC screenings on the fund, the investment advisor/management company, and/or the general partners or other similar senior officers by conducting Internet research or another similar service or third-party confirmation.Onboarding of Peer-to-Peer Lending Companies[Insert Financial Institution Here] will partner with one or several Peer-To-Peer Lending Companies (“P2P”) to issue unsecured consumer and business loans to borrowers with certain credit profiles.  The Bank requires each P2P lending company to develop and implement a written BSA/AML program that is reasonably designed to prevent the company from being used to facilitate money laundering or the financing of terrorist activities.  At a minimum, the anti-money laundering program shall:  provide for policies and procedures to prevent money laundering and detect suspicious activity; designate a compliance officer; provide for ongoing training of appropriate persons; and provide for periodic independent testing of the AML program.  The Bank also requires each P2P lending company to adopt a Customer Identification Program that is in compliance with the Bank’s Customer Identification policies.  The selection of the P2P lending companies will be based on, but not limited to, the following:Adequacy of BSA/AML policies and proceduresReview of results from compliance, BSA/AML and IT auditsBank management will request that BSA/AML audits be performed prior to the commencement of any funding.  For new companies, a 2-step process will be employed whereby the policies will be reviewed for adequacy and control and the transaction testing will be performed 60 days after program launch. The results will be reviewed thoroughly, and findings will be detailed in a memo to the BOD. Refer to the “Peer-to-Peer Lending Policy” for a detailed description of the requirements for P2P lending companiesReliance on OthersIn those instances in which a financial intermediary introduces its client to the Company and the intermediary’s customer opens an account and/or otherwise enters into a contractual relationship with one or more of the Bank’s business units, KYC due diligence on the contracting party is the responsibility of the business unit; however, businesses are permitted to rely on the customer identification and verification procedures of another financial institution to establish the identity of the customer.  Reliance, for purposes of such safe harbor, is appropriate when the other financial institution has established a similar banking/business relationship with the customer to that of the Company and when such reliance can be considered reasonable under the circumstances.  In order to be able to rely on the customer identification procedures of another financial institution, the other entity:Must be subject to the AML program requirements set forth in the USA PATRIOT Act and implementing regulationsMust be regulated by a U.S. Federal functional regulator, andMust enter into a contract with the Bank requiring the other financial institution to certify annually that it has implemented its AML program and that it, or its agent, will perform the customer identification and verification program requirements.In instances in which the intermediary to be relied upon is not subject to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act, that intermediary:Must be subject to money laundering control requirements under its local laws and regulationsMust be regulated by a recognizable financial services regulator in the country of jurisdictionMust provide a letter of attestation to the Bank in which its attests to its compliance with all appropriate customer identification, verification, and other due diligence requirements.In all cases in which a business is placing reliance upon an intermediary for the performance of any customer identification or other KYC due diligence steps, the prior, written approval must be obtained from the BSA/AML Compliance Officer.  This approval is required whether the entity relied upon is U.S. or non-U.S. intermediary.KYC information provided by new employees who bring customers with them from other financial institutions must be independently obtained and verified by someone other than the new employee.Ongoing Relationship/Customer/Account ActivitiesKYC records are intended to be dynamic and enhanced over time as knowledge of a customer grows.  The relationship owner will review and update KYC information whenever significant changes in activity, ownership, or public information about the client become known.The Bank uses an automated monitoring system in order to monitor account activity, on an on-going basis.  The automated monitoring system analyzes transactions for unusual activity, and generates alerts for review.  A Compliance Analyst reviews these alerts on a daily basis.  Also in regard to the ACH environment, the Operations Department will review the following reports on a daily basis for unusual activity and scanning:Entries – Checking PL6570-01Entries – Savings PL6570-06Originating Entries PL5500-02OFAC Screening – Org Final PL6579-04 (IATs)OFAC Screening – Receiving Final PL6579-02 (IATs)OFAC Screening – ACH OFAC Rec (PL6579-01)ACH Originating Activity (PL2000-02)Return/NOC Activity Listing (PL2000-01)Special Edits Updates (PL6564-01)Death Notification ReportInternational (IAT) RDFI ReportReceiver Setup ReportNotification of Change ODFI Report Originator Setup ReportReturn Item-ODFI ReportIn addition to the daily reports, the following ACH reports are reviewed monthlyACH Volume Report per OriginatorReturn Ratio Report per OriginatorUnusual activity may encompass the following:Reviewing originators/recipients’ whose business or occupation does not warrant the volume or nature of ACH activity;Originators whose origination activity suddenly exceeds projections/credit-debit limits with no reasonable explanation for such change;Originators generating a high rate or high volume of invalid account returns or a high-rate or high volume of unauthorized returns/transactions;Specific returns creations (RDFI) covering unauthorized, fraudulent, or revoked transactions, and Federal reclamations.Unusual conditions will be investigated and handled appropriately by the reviewer.  Such examination of these daily reports must be evidenced by the reviewer by initialing the Daily Account Review Log or the report printout.In order to monitor ongoing wire transfer records quarterly, the branch manager/designee will review the Wire Transfer Velocity Report for questionable and/or unusual patterns.  Particular attention will be paid to incidents where:Unexplained or sudden extensive wire activity, especially in accounts that had little or no previous activity;A large number of wire transfers to or from unrelated third parties inconsistent with the customer’s legitimated business purpose;Wire transfers that have no apparent business purpose to or from a foreign country;The customer’s account has inflows of funds or other assets well beyond the known income or resources of the customer;Transactions in which the primary beneficiary or counter-party is undisclosed. The branch manager/designee will sign the quarterly report as evidence that the quarterly review was conducted.Unusual Activity Detected by a P2P Lending Company:  Each Peer-To-Peer Lending Company (P2P) that [Insert Financial Institution Here] (the Bank) partners with is required to have an Anti-money Laundering program.  As part of the program, the P2P lending company must have policies and procedures to detect and identify suspicious activity.  When a P2P lending company identifies suspicious activity, they notify the Loan Service Department at [Insert Financial Institution Here] of the unusual activity.  The Loan Service Department works with the P2P lending company to prepare an Incident Report.   A Compliance Analyst and the Bank’s AML/BSA Officer, review the incident report to determine whether the activity warrants a Suspicious Activity Report filing.    Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) Filing:   Upon detection of unusual activity, it is the Bank’s policy to file a SAR with respect to:Criminal violations involving insider abuse in any amount;Criminal violations aggregating $5,000 or more when a suspect can be identified;Criminal violations aggregating $25,000 or more regardless of a potential suspect;Transactions conducted or attempted by, at, or through the bank (or an affiliate) and aggregating $5,000 or more, if the bank or affiliate knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect the transaction:May involve potential money laundering or other illegal activity;Is designed to evade the BSA or its implementing regulations;Has no business or apparent lawful purpose, or is not the type of transaction that the particular customer would normally be expected to engage in, and the Bank knows of no reasonable explanation for the transaction after examining the available facts, including the background and possible purpose of the transaction.Note:  Because elderly individuals experience declining cognitive or physical abilities, they are more reliant on specific individuals for their physical well-being, financial management, and social interaction.  Therefore, certain elderly individuals may be particularly vulnerable to identity theft, embezzlement, and fraudulent schemes.  See Appendix I for Possible Signs of Elder Financial Exploitation.An investigation will be conducted for any activity deemed suspicious and if necessary, a SAR will be filed.  This Policy provides for a process of periodic, risk-based customer relationship reviews.  In the absence of an event that calls immediate attention to a relationship or to activity in the customer’s accounts, the periodic review provides the Bank with the opportunity to update KYC information, review the customer’s recent transactions and interactions with the Bank, and reaffirm that retaining the relationship continues to be appropriate.The periodic review is to be performed by the relationship owner and should:Ensure that KYC information is accurate, complete, and up-to-dateConsider the effects of any significant inflows, outflows, and any obvious changes in the accounts’ purposes, for appropriateness and consistency with expectations.Evaluate the customers’ general transaction volumes and overall balances across all products and services for reasonableness and consistency with the customer’s financial situation and the relationship’s stated purpose.Periodic reviews will occur at least every 12 months for high-risk customers and 24 for medium-risk customers.  The first month of each quarter, high risk accounts having a yearly anniversary in that quarter, based on the date of the assigned risk rating, will be identified.  During that three-month period, a review will be performed using the Standard Account Review Sheet.  The review method for medium risk accounts would be the same but based upon a two-year anniversary of the assigned risk rating date.  The Standard Account Review Sheet is subject to the necessary review and approval based on established requirements.Refer to Appendix G for Standard Account Review SheetSpecial MeasuresThe USA PATRIOT Act gives the Secretary of the Treasury authority to impose special measures against foreign jurisdictions, foreign financial institutions, transactions involving such jurisdictions or institutions, or one or more types of accounts, that are determined to pose a “primary money laundering concern” to the United States.The BSA/AML Compliance Officer will coordinate compliance with such special measures on a bank-wide basis.  It is the policy of the Bank to promptly comply with any special measures prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.  Whenever the Secretary imposes special measures, Compliance shall communicate the special measures to the affected businesses, which will take the steps necessary to terminate affected account relationships, communicate to customers, and/or amend existing policies, procedures, and controls or develop new ones to comply with the prescribed special measures.Information SharingThe USA PATRIOT Act provides for information sharing between the Government and Financial Institutions, as well as between financial institutions themselves, in an effort to deter money laundering and terrorist activities.Section 314(a) of the Act establishes a mechanism for law enforcement agencies to communicate the names of suspected terrorists and money launderers to covered financial institutions for the purpose of promptly identifying accounts and transactions involving those suspects.  Under 314(a), information requests are batched and forwarded to covered financial institutions from FinCEN every two weeks (although single requests may be sent in urgent situations).  Note:  The designated points of contact for receiving 314(a) are reflected on the Bank’s Call Report Filings.Upon receipt of a 314(a) request, Company covered financial institutions are required to search the following records:Deposit account recordsFunds transfer recordsRecords for the sale of monetary instrumentsLoan recordsThe Bank will search its records for the preceding 12 months for accounts, and for the preceding 6 months for transactions, and report them to FinCEN.  As the Bank has several third party, and marketplace lenders, in addition to the scan of accounts, and transactions, the Bank will conduct a FinCEN scan for any retained loans as well as any loans funded within the last 12 months.  If other matching records are found in this process, they will also be reported to FinCEN, even if they fall outside of the requested time frame or pertain to an account or transaction in an area of the financial institution that was not required to be searched but were searched anyway, or pertain to a record that was not required to be maintained under federal law or regulation but existed nonetheless.Searches are required to be completed and a response to be sent to FinCEN with any matches within two weeks of receiving the 314(a) request.If there is a positive match for an account or a transaction, the following information will be gathered:The identity of the individual, entity, or organizationThe account number(s); opening date, type of transactionsAll identifying information provided by the account holder in connection with the opening of the account, such as social security number, taxpayer identification number, passport information, date of birth, and address.Names are highly confidential and should be shared only on a limited basis.  Under no circumstances should 314(a) names be shared with any other financial institution.  Records regarding 314(a) searches must be retained in a secure area.If the 314(a) search results in a positive match, it is incumbent upon the Bank to conduct an investigation of the account relationship and/or transaction activity and should there be reasonable belief that suspicious activity occurred, an Incident Report must be drafted for SAR consideration.  If the Bank decides to close the account, it will first notify the law enforcement contact on the request to determine if closing the account would interfere with an active investigation.  If law enforcement requests that an account remain open, the bank will request written confirmation.Note:  The bank does not participate in 314(b)Refer to Appendix H for procedures concerning responses to information requests Subpoenas Received from Law EnforcementThe receipt of a grand jury subpoena will cause the bank to conduct a risk assessment and account relationship review of the subject customer.  The information resulting from the review, transactions, and accounts subject to the subpoena will be evaluated and a determination will be made as to whether additional account monitoring should be implemented, or a suspicious activity report filed.Currency Transaction Reporting and ExemptionsIn compliance with the BSA regulations, the following types of reports are submitted to the U.S. government:FinCEN Form 112, Currency Transaction Report (CTR):  A CTR must be filed for each deposit, withdrawal, exchange of currency, or other payment or transfer, by, through or to a financial institution, which involves a transaction in currency of more than $10,000.  Multiple currency transactions must be treated as a single transaction if the financial institution has knowledge that:  (a) they are conducted by or on behalf of the same person; and, (b) they result in cash received or disbursed by the financial institution of more than $10,000.  A CTR must be filed within 15 days electronically from the date of the transaction with FinCEN.  The bank must retain copies of CTRs for five years from the date of the report.FinCEN Form 105, Report of International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments (CMIR):  Each person who physically transports, mails or ships, or causes to be physically transported, mailed, shipped or received, currency, traveler’s checks, and certain other monetary instruments in an aggregate amount exceeding $10,000 into or out of the United States must file a CMIR.The preparation process of these reports will be through the Bank’s automated monitoring system. The automated monitoring system loads Cleartouch data into the system, and when reportable transactions are found, auto-generates populated CTRs. The branch manager is responsible for performing a secondary review to ensure accuracy and submitting the report.    Currency transactions over $3,000 are recorded daily on the “Currency Transactions Greater Than $3,000 Log”.  Daily, this log is reviewed by the branch manager/designee to ensure that multiple currency transactions totaling over $10,000 for a customer are properly reported.  This log also must be reviewed for possible structuring situations and initialed as evidence of review.  On a monthly basis, the branch manager/designee will review this report on a cumulative basis to detect patterns or structuring trends.  The branch manager/designee will evidence this review by signing this monthly report. Structuring is the breaking up of transactions for the purpose of evading the BSA reporting and recordkeeping requirements and, if appropriate thresholds are met, should be reported as a suspicious transaction.  Structuring may be indicative of underlying illegal activity; further, structuring itself is unlawful under the BSA.Penalties and asset forfeiture for money laundering can be severe under BSA:Individuals, including employees of financial institutions, convicted of money laundering face up to 20 years in prison for each money-laundering transaction.Businesses, including banks and individuals, face fines up to $1,000,000 or twice the value of the transaction, whichever is greater.Financial Institutions can lose their charter/license, and employees risk being removed and barred from the business.Any property involved in the transaction or traceable to the proceeds of the criminal activity, including loan collateral, personal property and, under certain conditions, entire bank accounts (even if some of the money in the account is legitimate) may be subject to forfeiture.Safe Harbor Provision The Annunzio Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act (1992) – U.S.C. 5318(g)(3) - provides a safe harbor for the bank and its employee from civil liability for reporting known or suspected criminal offenses or suspicious activity by filing a SAR. A bank employee should feel safe in reporting suspicious activity.  The government works closely with the bank to ensure that all employees are protected from any liability.  Federal Law prohibits Employees from disclosing the fact that a SAR has been filed.  Never discuss any Suspicious Activity Reporting requirements with a customer. Voluntarily giving additional information to customers, such as when you completed an incident report for their suspicious activity makes the employee liable for prosecution for violating Anti-Money Laundering Laws.Recordkeeping and Record Retention RequirementsThe following rules apply to CIP-related records:Identifying information (name, address, date of birth, and government-issued ID number) must be retained for five years after the date the account is closedAll other information and documentation required by CIP rules, such as other recorded customer information, copies of documents used to verify identity, records of the steps taken and the results of verification performed by non-documentary means, and the resolution of discrepancies that may have arisen between information provided by a customer and the documentary and non-documentary evidence used to verify such information, must be retained for five years after the record is made.KYC-related records can be maintained in either hard copy or in electronic form, so long as the records are accurate and readily accessible within five calendar days.The Bank must maintain a record of each funds transfer of $3,000 or more, which it originates, acts as an intermediary for, or receives for five years.  The amount and type of information that must be recorded and kept depends upon the Bank’s role in the funds transfer process.  Also, the Bank must pass certain information along to the next bank in the funds transfer chain when it acts as an originator or intermediary for a funds transferTransmitter’s Financial InstitutionIntermediary Financial InstitutionName and account number of the transmitterAll of the information included in the payment order by the transmitter’s financial institution, plus;Address of the transmitterName and address or numerical identifier of the transmitter’s financial institutionIdentity of the transmitter’s financial institutionAmount of the transmittalExecution date of the transmittal orderIdentity of the recipients’ financial institutionAnd as many of the following items as are received with the transmittal:Name and address of the recipientAccount number of the recipientOther specific identifiers of the recipientThe Bank which provides for the purchase and sale of monetary instruments must require the retention of records of cash sale to a customer for bank checks, drafts, cashier’s checks, money orders, and traveler’s checks (which the Bank does not currently sell) between $3,000 and $10,000 inclusive for five years.  These records must include evidence of verification of the identity of the purchaser and other information as outlined below:The name of the purchaser;Date of purchase;Types of instrument purchased;Serial number of the instrument purchased; The amounts in dollars of each of the instruments purchased; andVerification that the individual is a deposit holder/verification or the purchaser’s identity (address, SS#/Alien Identification #, DOB).The following records will be retained for seven years:A record of each extension of credit in an amount in excess of $10,000Each document granting signature authority over each deposit or share accountEach statement, ledger card or other record on each deposit or share account, showing each transaction in, or with respect to, that accountEach check, clean draft, or money order drawn on the Company or issued and payable by itEach item in excess of $100 comprising a debit to a customer’s deposit or share accountRecords prepared or received in the ordinary course of business, which would be needed to reconstruct a transaction account and to trace a check in excess of $100Each deposit slip or credit ticket reflecting a transaction in excess of $100.AML TrainingAnnually the Bank shall maintain a regular training program for the purpose of educating its personnel and heightening their awareness so that they will be knowledgeable and vigilant in their efforts to recognize and report activity, which may constitute money laundering.Within 60 days of hire, new employees will be trained in the basic aspect of AML.  Additionally, the new employee will be required to read and attest that they understand the contents of the Bank’s AML/BSA policies.The appropriate attendance records and training materials will be retained for three years.   Note:  Training will be conducted at least annually for the Board of Directors.BSA/AML Compliance OfficerThe BSA/AML Compliance Officer has day-to-day responsibility for managing all aspects of the Bank’s AML Program and compliance with AML laws and regulations.  The BSA/AML Compliance Officer is also responsible for the maintenance of this Policy and for considering deviations to this Policy.  In addition, the BSA/AML Compliance Officer advises staff regarding the application of anti-money laundering laws and regulations and on money laundering trends and patterns specific to certain businesses.Despite changes in management or employee composition or structure, the BSA/AML Compliance Officer will ensure that all requirements of an effective BSA/AML program are implemented and that the program contains all appropriate aspects to be in compliance with all laws and regulations. BSA/AML Risk AssessmentThe Bank has developed a risk assessment, which was approved by the Board of Directors, by identifying risks along with the associated mitigants.  The assessment will be periodically reviewed and presented to the Board for approval.Independent TestingIndependent testing commensurate with the BSA/AML risk profile of the bank will be conducted every 12 to 18 months by outside auditors.  Upon completion, the auditors conducting the BSA/AML test will report the results to the Audit Committee.Board ReportingOn an annual basis or more frequently as circumstances dictate, the BSA/AML Compliance Officer will present a report to the Board of Directors.  This report will include such important facts relating compliance initiatives, any deficiencies/corrective action noted, SAR filings relating to AML, etc.APPENDIX AEXAMPLES OF SUSPICIOUS CONDUCT AND TRANSACTIONSThe existence of one or more of these suspicious circumstances does not mean that money laundering activity is taking place, but that such circumstances should be scrutinized carefully.Customers who are reluctant to provide normal information when opening an account or who provide fictitious or conflicting information.Customers with no discernible reason for using the Bank’s services (e.g. customers with distant addresses who could find the same services nearer to home)Business customers who are reluctant to provide complete information regarding the purpose, prior banking relationships, officers or directors, or location of their business.Business customers who are reluctant to reveal details about their activities, or to provide financial statements, or whose financial statements are noticeably different from those of similar businesses.Large cash deposits by an individual or business where checks and other instruments are the expected norm.Structuring multiple cash deposits which are individually unexceptional, but significant in the aggregate.Exchanging large quantities of low denomination currencies for those of higher denomination.Deposit or withdrawal activity that is inconsistent with the activity normally associated with the customer or the customer’s type of business.Funds transfers are sent or received from the same person to or from different accounts.Funds activity is unexplained, repetitive, or shows unusual patterns.A customer uses unusual or suspicious identification documents that cannot be readily verified.The customer’s background differs from that which would be expected on the basis of his or her business activities.A customer is reluctant to provide information needed to file a mandatory report, to have the report filed, or to proceed with a transaction after being informed that the report must be filed.A person uses the automated teller machine to make several bank deposits below a specified threshold.The currency transaction activity reflected a sudden change inconsistent with normal activities.A customer purchases a number of cashier’s checks, money orders, or traveler’s checks for large amounts under a specified threshold.Suspicious movements of funds occur from one bank to another and then funds are moved back to the first bank.Deposits of large third-party checks endorsed in favor of the customer where such conduct is inconsistent with the customer’s normal activity.Large numbers of individuals making payments into the same account without adequate explanation.Unexpected repayment of problem loans.Requests to provide or arrange financing where the source of the customer’s financial contribution to a deal is unclear, particularly where property is involved.Employees whose habits or lifestyles change unexpectedlyEmployees whose performance changes unexpectedly.The stated occupation of the customer is not commensurate with the type of level of activity.Regarding nonprofit or charitable organizations, financial transactions occur for which there appears to be no logical economic purpose or in which there appears to be no link between the stated activity of the organization and the other parties in the transaction.For additional examples of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing “Red Flags” see the FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual 11/17/2014.APPENDIX BCOUNTRY TIERING

FinCEN posts on its secure website a list of individuals, entities and organizations which are under investigation by one or more federal agencies.  All financial institutions covered by 314(a) of the USA Patriot Act are required to quickly search their records to determine whether they maintain or have engaged in transactions with any of the named subjects.If the Bank finds a match with a subject named on FinCEN’s 314(a) list, the match must be reported to FinCEN by making an entry on FinCEN’s secure website no later than fourteen (14) calendar days after the list was posted.  At that point, a federal agency may follow up with a subpoena for specified documents.  That subpoena is processed like any other subpoena from law enforcement.  If the Bank has no match, no response is necessary.A search of all pertinent Bank systems that contain customer information to determine whether or not the Company has any “hits” for the names listed on the request.  The appropriate affirmative responses are entered on the FinCEN secure website.Also the pertinent account or transactional activity is analyzed, and if the filing of a SAR is warranted, a SAR is prepared and filed.All Bank employees involved in the processing and handling of 314(a) requests are required to keep the information confidential.

. Document Name - FYE 1979 BSA_AML_OFAC Risk Assessment_JW.docx    - BSA/AML & OFAC Annual Risk AssessmentsAssessment Period: July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016OverviewJ. Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include one to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundation in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function.Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function.The BSA/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an individual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk.The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effectiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit.Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to effectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place.Executive SummaryThe risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earnings, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts.It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s customers, products, services, and geographies.As a result of the BSA/AML Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following:Number of cash-intensive business customers;Number of SARs filed for cash structuring;Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA;Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and remote deposit capture;Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations.Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE.As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following:Volume of higher risk NRA customers;Wire transfers from international locations;International ACH transactionsHowever, due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW.These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues.The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA and OFAC compliance program commensurate with the Bank’s risk profile. Such a program includes effective administration of the Customer Identification Program, Customer Due Diligence Procedures and Enhanced Due Diligence Procedures to address appropriately the risks identified, as well as robust programs for training Bank staff and for the independent testing of the BSA/AML/OFAC programs.To ensure that the Bank’s controls remain at least adequate to maintain the residual risks of its activities within tolerable levels, the BSA/AML/OFAC program includes the following priorities:Maintain rigorous programs to increase compliance awareness bank wide.Provide advanced BSA AML business line training on an ongoing basis.Maintain programs to embed responsibility for BSA AML compliance in each of the Bank’s lines of business.Maintain robust KYC/CDD/EDD processes.Maintain rigorous CIP and SAR procedures.Maintain robust transaction monitoring for higher risk customers / products.Continue to evaluate the adequacy of reporting to management and the Board of Directors.Continue to evaluate the effectiveness of the Bank’s BSA AML transaction monitoring system, Patriot Officer and soon to be migrated to FIS PRIME.During the last fiscal year, Mercadien, P.C., Certified Public Accountants (“Mercadien”) completed a BSA AML System Optimization for the Bank. The independent review included procedures to verify the quality of alerts being generated for the purposes of monitoring at the Bank.Mercadien concluded that the Bank’s transaction monitoring system parameters appear adequate, as established, to detect potentially suspicious activity for review. Mercadien recommended deletions and additions to the scenarios being run by Patriot in an effort to reduce redundant rules and enhance the Bank’s coverage. These recommendations were implemented in the 4th quarter of FYE 15’, which led to more efficiency in the Bank’s transaction monitoring for suspicious activity.GRC Risk Solutions, LLC (“GRC”) completed a validation of the AML transaction monitoring system, Patriot Officer. The independent validation included the following:Review of BSA/AML System Design Review BSA/AML Workflow Processing Review of List Monitoring Alerts Performance of a detailed, system-driven Transaction Code Mapping exercise for transaction codes identified during the three-month period Performance of Alert Detection scenario coverage verification. The validation concluded the following:Bank customers, non-customers, accounts, and transactions are scrubbed through the appropriate sanction screening lists. All transaction codes are properly mapped between the core system (i.e., FIS Bankway) and the BSA/AML system (i.e., Patriot Officer). All wire transactions, foreign and domestic, are properly mapped between FIS Bankway and Patriot Officer. The Patriot Officer system has adequate transaction coverage across the Bank’s products and services. However, some minor recommendations are noted below. MethodologyThe BSA/AML/OFAC risk assessment follows guidance in the most current edition of the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual (the “FFIEC Manual”) last updated in December 2014. This report sets forth the results of the risk assessments as of June 30, 2016. It estimates J. Wallace Bank’s vulnerability to illegal activity (including terrorist financing), as well as to possible OFAC violations taking into account the identification and measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with its products, services, customers, and the geographic locations of its operations and its customers. This report concludes with a discussion of the need, if any, for enhancements to the Bank’s policies, procedures or programs for training and testing possibly warranted taking into account both the Bank’s current operations and its near-term growth plans, including the planned introduction of new products and services, as well as whether the Bank appropriately allocates resources to the BSA/AML/OFAC compliance functions. Non-compliance with BSA/AML/OFAC laws, regulations, rules or regulatory requirements – and non-compliance with internal policies and procedures adopted to achieve compliance with them – is likely to have a significant adverse effect on earnings, capital, reputation, franchise value and growth opportunities. Such non-compliance exposes J. Wallace to enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payments of damages and the voiding of contracts.The Bank prepared a baseline risk assessment profile relating its preparedness and exposure to respond to a broad set of BSA/AML conditions – specifically concerning its own business risk.  The Bank considered information about its current products, services, geographic areas for service, customers, and international presence in determining its risk exposure to money-laundering and terrorist financing activity.  Based upon this assessment the Bank developed appropriate customer due diligence, suspicious activity monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping controls appropriate to manage its risk exposure.Within the Risk Assessment profile there are numerous risk exposure characteristics that were considered in which the Bank weighed the probability of money laundering or terrorist financing activity occurring.  Additionally, independent of probability, the Bank estimated the scope of impact and relevant scale of the impact to the business that would result if the event actually occurred or a deficiency was made known in our BSA/AML program. Furthermore, the assessment considered the Bank’s resources and readiness to comply with BSA/AML requirements, our policy, procedures, and controls by weighing:Experience – Level of knowledge and experience by staff in managing BSA compliance programs, analytical experience in detecting money laundering and terrorist financing schemes, and administration management in reporting and recordkeeping.Training – Depth, frequency, and comprehensiveness of training to general staff, personnel with BSA responsibilities, and BSA Department personnel. Testing – Validation of the BSA/AML program through independent testing. Program – Comprehensiveness of Policy, procedures, and controls necessary to manage the risk exposure in those areas of greatest risk and attaining compliance with the regulations and laws.In reviewing the Probability of an event due to the nature of customer, product, and service against its potential Impact and the need for the Bank to maintain a strong Readiness response capability; the Bank derived overall Risk Exposure prioritization ratings that reflect the Bank’s priority to take action in establishing programs to effectively manage the risk to an acceptable level. CaveatsThese risk assessments include subjective assessments of the magnitude of inherent risk and of the effectiveness of mitigating controls. Neither the risk assessments themselves nor the procedures for developing them, however, provide a validation of these assessments. The Bank’s internal audit service provider performs such a validation through its independent testing of the Bank’s exposure to BSA/AML/OFAC risks and the effectiveness of its controls in mitigating those risks. These subjective assessments, however, do take into account the service provider’s results, as well as the results of supervisory examinations, including identified violations of law and enforcement actions.Not all activities are clearly illegal/improper or clearly legitimate/proper, until appropriate authorities designate such activity as legal or illegal.Forward Looking RiskThere have been no significant changes in J. Wallace existing products, services, and business strategy during the assessment period. The bank is de-emphasizing retail and continues to seek aggressive growth primarily in commercial businesses, with a particular emphasis on financing multi-family apartments.The following is a high level summary of modeled strategic scenarios that the Bank may consider in the future.Scenario 1: Organic Growth ScenarioOrganic Growth ScenarioContinued loan platform in CRE, but maintain concentration below Board limitsPayment of regular quarterly cash dividends and special dividends each DecemberScenario 2: Scenario 1 plusFed Forecast Rate EnvironmentCRE loan originations decline by 10% (since prepayment speed slow and loans extend)Scenario 3: Scenario 1 plusScenario 1 with a reduction in all loan originations of 15% and deposit growth of 10%BSA/AML Direction of RiskThe J. Wallace BSA/AML Risk Assessment performed as of June 30, 2016 yielded a HIGH Inherent Risk Rating and a MODERATE Residual Risk Rating, which is consistent with the risk rating of the previous assessment. The direction of Risk over the next 12 months is expected to be trending slightly higher as a result of the following:Moderate turnover at the management level;Moderate turnover in Corporate staff positions;High and critical turnover in Branch staff positions (Tellers);Moderate increase in incoming international wire activity;Moderate increase in high risk customers;Aggressive growth in lending, retail and commercial banking;Moderate to high increase in eBanking and RDC product lines.Bank SizeJ. Wallace falls under Uniform Bank Performance Report (UBPR) 101S SUPPLEMENTAL PEER GROUP, defined as all Stock-owned insured savings banks in excess of $1 billion. As of June 30, 2016, total asset size of J. Wallace was $3,669,338,000. From the last assessment period with an asset size of $3,353,065,000, the bank has grown about 1% and management continues to seek aggressive growth.Branch LocationsThe number of J. Wallace branches increased by one to 99 with the addition of the Westwood branch. All J. Wallace branches are located in both HIDTA / HIFCA zone. HIFCA stands for High Intensity Financial Crime Area. HIDTA stands for High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas. HIFCA areas were created through legislation as a means of concentrating law enforcement efforts at the federal, state, and local levels in high intensity money laundering zones. The number of branches located in HIDTA/HIFCA zones has not changed since last assessment period. J. Wallace provides deposit, retail banking and commercial banking.The Bank’s 99 branch offices are located in 4 Northern NJ Counties: Bergen, Hudson, Passaic and Essex Counties. The bank has considered the areas serviced by its offices and areas of its customers’ residences and business locations. Comprehensive training for all departments was completed during the year with these factors in mind. The uses of the Patriot Officer Automated Anti-Money Laundering System and employee training have increased awareness and detection of suspicious activity but the Bank’s inherent risk remains High due to the area designations.Overseas Branches/Parallel BankingJ. Wallace does not have overseas branches, nor does it maintain any Parallel Banking relationships. Management does not seek to open any overseas branches at this time or enter into any parallel banking relationships.Mergers & AcquisitionsThere have not been any mergers or acquisitions during the assessment period and management does not foresee any such activity in the near future.Potential or Pending Legal ProceedingsAs of June 30, 2016 there is no material pending or material potential legal proceeding involving J. Wallace Financial Corp., J. Wallace Bank, or its subsidiaries. Customer BaseThe Bank considered the nature of its customers and the type of account opening activity, longevity of accounts, and transitory nature of its customers.  The Bank has been established as a community Bank since 1911 and supports a growing customer base within its market area. In addition, the commercial lending department has expanded our market area to surrounding states. The Bank has a total of 6 Nonresident Alien account owners with 6 total accounts. These accounts are opened only when prescribed written criteria are met but some degree of growth would have no effect on our risk. Despite this growth and expansion our risk exposure remains as Moderate.As of 6/30/2016, J. Wallace Bank’s deposit customer base consisted of 18,960 Consumer and 4,267 Business & Non-Personal accounts. The total balance for consumer accounts was $1,625,482,189.00 and $634,517,108.00 for business accounts.Although, there is a moderate decrease in customer growth from last assessment period, BSA staff remains sufficiently staffed to identify, research and report suspicious activities taking into consideration the bank’s overall risk profile and the volume of transactions.Number of Transactional Accounts 201631841     201532489     648-1.99%Account Type FYE 2016FYE 2015Difference % Increase/Decrease  Savings $165,623,337$160,020,589.13$5,602,7483.38% *CDs and IRAs $959,534,062$761,566,721.75$197,967,34020.63% Personal DDA $167,412,615$179,096,031.12-$11,683,416-6.98% Personal MMDA $332,912,175$288,950,192.20$43,961,98313.21% Business DDA $285,719,693$243,808,181.95$41,911,51114.67% Business MMDA $348,797,415$108,148,095.22$240,649,32068.99% $2,259,999,297$1,741,589,811.37$518,409,48622.94%Account Type20162015Difference %Increase/Decrease Personal18,96018,8511090.57%Business & Non-Personal4,2673,9163518.23%    23,227                     22,7674601.98%Increases in personal transactional accounts were not overly significant at 0.57%. Business and other non-personal accounts increased by 8.23% and continued efforts in FYE 2017 will be made to increase this market segment.CIP/CDD/EDDAt account opening, customer identification is required and verified through documentary and non- documentary methods and a customer profile is created. CIP is performed on any person or business (including business account signers) opening an account. Each person must present primary and secondary forms of identification consistent with the requirements outlined the CIP Procedures. At a minimum, the following information must be obtained: name, date of birth, tax identification number, physical address, occupation, line of business and telephone number. For “persons” other than individuals (such as; corporations, partnerships, or trusts), J. Wallace requires documentation showing the legal existence of the entity. Customer due diligence is performed for all types of customers, and enhance due diligence is performed for higher risk customers at account opening and throughout the term of the relationship. Accounts are usually denied if negative records are found through verifications. All customers are subject to periodic reviews based on their risk levels.Per Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, the Bank reviewed its Customer Identification Program (“CIP”) considering the law’s requirements. The CIP defines the procedures and activities within the Bank for complying with the BSA/AML regulations and all new account openings apply CIP requirements. These include:Risk based account opening verification procedures and controls to verify the identity of any person or business entity seeking to open an account.Record maintenance procedures to record the information used to verify the person or business identity.Collecting sufficient information to develop a transaction profile on all new customers. The primary objective of this procedure is to enable the Bank to predict with relative certainty the transaction activity in which the customer is likely to be engaged.Reporting responsibilities and procedures for account opening activities that identify suspicious activity which may warrant investigation and/or the required filing of a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) to authorities.Periodic review and reporting by the Bank’s BSA Department on customers to determine whether the person or entity appears on any government agency lists of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations.Initial and recurring training on both the regulations and the Banks Customer Identification Program; such training to occur at least annually.Management and Board of Director reporting requirements.Revisions are made as needed to the CIP, with a minimum of an annual review.Compliance verification review of the Banks Customer Identification Program in accordance with the Interagency CIP examination procedures to be completed by an independent party.Periodic monitoring of compliance with CIP policies and procedures by the BSA/AML Officer.The Bank does not currently make use of the Reliance Provision for account opening, but may consider in the future. If the Bank does make use of the Reliance Provision, prior to doing so will evaluate its’ procedures and controls and effect necessary changes to this policy.High Risk Customers J. Wallace has a moderate number of high risk customers and a moderate number of cash-intensive retail business and service provider customers, such as Accountants, Doctors, Dentists, MSB’s, food stores, restaurants and super markets.The number of cash intensive businesses has decreased with Charitable Organizations, Accountants & CPA’s, other service providers, retail stores and restaurants seeing a moderate increase. Doctors, Dentists, Lawyers, MSB’s and Jewelry Stores have relatively remained static since last assessment period. The Bank considered the account classifications of high-risk customers and businesses as defined in the Bank's Customer Risk Classifications Procedures. Also considered were research of account activity, front line personnel experience and the current regulatory environment. Use of the Automated Anti-Money Laundering System, Patriot Officer and employee training has increased awareness and detection of suspicious activity. During previous risk assessment periods the increased focus on obtaining retail business customers doubled customers considered high risk which necessitated increased and ongoing monitoring of these customers transactions. During the current assessment period there was a decrease in the number of high risk customers, from 220 to 157, a decrease of 63 customers or 29%.Due to the reclassification of accounts during the 3rd quarter, there were 157 customers reclassified as High Risk and scheduled for EDD which was completed. This decrease was due to the review of 63 accounts; mostly professional service providers who while inherently high risk had at least 3 consecutive reviews with no unusual or suspicious activity. These 63 customers were however placed in monitoring status in the transaction monitoring system Patriot Officer to immediately notify the department of any suspicious activity. The current high risk customer list stands at 157.The following procedure is in place for a potential Watch List match:Watch List Report – If Matches Found – Change Record Status to “Undetermined” and assign the report to the BSA Department for review - Click Save. This will generate an email Alert to multiple persons for review. Do not proceed with the transaction until the report is approved by the BSA Department. Assign the Report to “BSA Department” and click “Save”. After approval you will receive an email advising the report has been assigned back to you. Access the report in your “Alert Inbox”; change the Alert State to “Close” and click “Save”. Print the Watch List Report. If a positive match is determined do not proceed with the transaction and follow OFAC Reporting Procedures.We currently have 157 customers classified as High Risk based on their business type. A breakdown of these customer classifications is as follows: High Risk by Type of BusinessNumber of CustomersDoctors & Dentists1Lawyers29Other Service Providers *15Money Service Business Agents (MSBs) *(Money Order Sales Agents who are also Convenience Stores, Pharmacies, or other retail.)32*32 of these businesses are also classified as Cash Intensive Businesses (CIB).Charitable Organizations1Jewelry Stores2Other Retail Stores and Restaurants *53Total133High Risk for Suspicious Activity24High Risk Watchlist CustomersHigh Risk for Suspicious Activity24High Risk by Type of Business133 157In addition, all High Risk customers are classified as such, on the Watch List for Suspicious Activity and monitored on a quarterly basis. Included in the 157 are 133 customers that are also classified as High Risk due to their business classification.Despite being located in a High Intensity Drug and Crime Risk Area and the additional re-classification of existing customers as High Risk it is believed the Risk Assessment remains as Moderate for the following reasons: the additional High Risk customers’ accounts were being monitored through Patriot Officer for suspicious activity before being re-classified; there has been no terrorist activity detected by the Bank or notified of by any law enforcement agency; there has been no appreciable increase in suspicious activity detected during the past 2 assessment periods; and, it is believed the use of the automated anti-money laundering detection system and the BSA employee training provided justifies the Risk Rating remaining as Moderate.Trade Finance, Import/Export CompaniesThe bank does not maintain any Trade Finance relationships. Politically Exposed Persons (“PEPs”)The bank does not accept or maintain accounts for PEPs. Money Service Businesses (“MSBs”)As a matter of policy, J. Wallace does not open or accept MSB accounts, only agents for MSBs such as Western Union.Third Party Payment ProcessorsThe day-to-day responsibility of oversight of Third Party Provider Management has been assigned to the Senior Vice President/Corporate Secretary who will interact with the primary relationship managers and periodically report to the Management Compliance Committee. An annual review will be provided to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors by the Management Compliance Committee.All Providers will be risk rated based on the nature of the Bank’s relationship or proposed relationship with the Provider. A rating of high, medium or low risk will be assigned to each Provider. The Provider will then be further classified based on likelihood of exposure to our customers’ non public personal information (“NPPI”). These ratings will be utilized to determine the level of due diligence that is required. Provider ratings will be reviewed annually to identify any relationships that might have changed during the course of the year.Products & Services J. Wallace continues to offer the following existing products and services:Consumer deposit products: Checking, Money Market, Statement and Passbook Savings, Certificate of Deposits, Traditional IRAs (CDs).Consumer lending product: Residential MortgagesCommercial deposit products: Business Checking, Money Market, Statement Savings, and Certificate of Deposits.Commercial lending products: Commercial Mortgage Loans, Commercial Lines of Credit, Term Loans, and Trade Financing.Sale of Monetary instruments (Cashier’s Checks, Money Orders, Travelers Checks and Gift Checks) to customers only.J. Wallace provides Electronic Banking services to its customers such as ATM cards, Debit Card, ACH, Remote Deposit Capture (RDC), Wire Transfers, and Internet. J. Wallace does not offer the following high risk products and services:Stored value cardsElectronic CashMonetary InstrumentsThe Bank does not sell monetary instruments or perform funds transfer for non-customers. Only J. Wallace customer (“on-us”) checks are cashed for non-customers up to a maximum of $500.00. Photo Identification is required and Watch List checks are performed for each. By limiting the issuance of these items to customers only mitigates the risk by enabling the Bank to monitor these items through the Bank’s automated anti-money laundering system. The Bank performs OFAC / Watch List Checks for all third party payees (non-customers) listed on Cashier’s Checks and J. Wallace Bank customer checks cashed in the branches.Business customer with payroll accounts requires an agreement on file with a list of current employees. Employees who do not have accounts with J. Wallace are required to present photo identification and Watch List checks are performed the 15th of every month and each time a new list is received. When cashing checks employees’ names are verified against the current list. The branches log on-us checks cashed but they have been logging them for both customers and non-customers. That practice has ceased and they will now only be logging on-us checks cashed for non-customers. The Vice President, Retail Banking believes the branches currently cash only a small amount of on-us checks for non-customers, excluding customer payroll checks. When these checks are cashed, including business customer payroll checks, valid current identification, such as a driver’s license or any other item listed in our new account procedures, is obtained and the information is recorded and retained and an OFAC Watch List Report is run and retained. The transaction is then approved by a supervisor.There were a total of 12 Bank Checks sold during the assessment period and 868 money order sales. The instruments were sold as follows: Bank Checks (12) totaling $144,295.93Money Orders (649) totaling $237,943.72Two branches (#7 and #30) did not have any monetary instrument sales for the risk assessment period.	The sale of monetary instruments is relatively low compared to the overall customer base. Branch Administration should consider amending the policy and procedures relating to Monetary Instruments. They should become more comprehensive by including regulatory guidance for processing Monetary Instruments and related definitions.Debit CardsDebit Card (Point of Sale (“POS”) Purchases) Transactions per monthDebit Card Transaction Volumes  Month/YearDDA PurchaseMC PurchaseMC Cash AdvanceMC Int'l PurchaseDDA Purchase/Cash BackTotal Debit Card Transaction VolumeJul-1516,97932,540103281,97051,827Aug-1516,85632,646103421,90951,763Sep-1516,33230,69063301,81749,175Oct-1517,45131,740103271,99551,523Nov-1517,56030,85763571,85150,631Dec-1520,08333,79064061,78556,070Jan-1615,93028,57423501,83946,695Feb-1615,93332,13063251,69750,091Mar-1618,23134,98723181,93455,472Apr-1617,69634,75283151,95754,728May-1619,15436,63143041,97758,070Jun-1618,21835,66583181,89356,102Jul-1618,68735,01703152,04056,059Total FYE Point of Sale (“POS”) Purchases FYE 2016FYE 2015IncreasePercent IncreasePOS688,206593,610151,61015.93%Fraud TotalsFraud TotalsClaimsItemsTotal Fraud AmtTotal RecoveryJan 15 to June 1595484$25,420.53$2,208.50July 15 to June 16123458$30,951.53$10,939.17 218942$56,372.06$13,147.67Total Amount of FY Fraud Claims FYE 2016FYE 2015IncreasePercent IncreaseFraud Claims Total$30,951.53$25,420.53$5,501.0021.75%Funds TransferWire TransfersThe Bank considered the nature of fund transfer activity including customers, locations, frequency, and currency amounts. No transfers are performed for non-customers and foreign wire transfers for customers are performed on an incoming basis only. All wire transfers are also entered manually through FSI’s Patriot Officer Wire Transfer Module. This enables staff to ensure all Foreign Wire Transfers received through US correspondent financial institutions are entered as Foreign Wires in the system.

Moreover, as a general rule, J. Wallace does not open non-face to face accounts. To alleviate the risks of illicit funds being integrated by the use of online bill pay, the current ACH parameters for the monthly review are reasonably designed to identify money laundering activity and/or suspicious or unusual activity at integration. In addition to the monthly monitoring of ACH transactions, the BSA staff also conducts quarterly and/or semi-annually review of high risk clients and total deposits for personal and non-personal customers to identify any possible money laundering activity at this stage.The statistics for users of mobile banking during the current assessment period are as follows:Mobile Banking StatisticsItem Description VolumeiPhone Apps Downloaded 1,868Android Apps Downloaded 1,395Total Apps Downloaded 3,263Mobile Deposit Enrollments 853Deposits - June 2015628$472,562.25Deposits - July 2015600$562,745.36Deposits - August 2015669$953,653.78Deposits - September 2015614$540,095.27Deposits - October 2015715$673,815.71Deposits - November 2015679$572,055.00Deposits - December 2015740$650,538.58Deposits - January 2016636$514,754.72Deposits - February 2016604$596,632.94Deposits - March 2016704$652,386.35Deposits - April 2016762$796,963.67Deposits - May 2016702$711,161.39Deposits - June 2016659$644,664.22Internet banking is closely monitored utilizing authentication methods and oversight procedures currently used together with methods available specifically for this product. The addition of an experienced eBanking Manager provides additional supervision and oversight. Since this is a relatively new product to the financial industry and bank. RDCJ. Wallace uses FSI Item Processing as its software vendor and third-party processor to provide remote deposit capture.Remote deposit capture refers to computer hardware, software and telecommunications systems that enable commercial customers to process deposits to their depositary accounts with J. Wallace Bank from electronic devices of varying descriptions located at their place of business or elsewhere by scanning and transmitting images of deposited items. Once scanned and transmitted, the physical checks are no longer needed except to keep as back up until the transaction is properly posted.Proper identification of all businesses and those authorizing business applications must be verified. High risk industries are to be identified and generally avoided; however, if exceptions are to be granted, these require additional scrutiny and additional levels of approval. BSA Guidelines are to be followed and "Know Your Customer" considerations in this context require the use of different identification, authentication, and transaction verification methods than those used with traditional delivery channels. It is the policy that documents requiring signatures, such as final contracts for services, require the client to meet with a bank representative and/or be verified as outlined in the bank's new business account procedures. New RDC accounts like all J. Wallace accounts must be completed in person with a bank representative present. Many of our RDC customers are also borrowers, often with locations distant from our branches.RDC policies, procedures, and activity monitoring process are in place and site visits are performed annually. Management has developed security controls that govern network and data access user authentication, transaction verification, and virus protection.Penetration TestingTests simulate the probable actions of unauthorized and authorized users.Business ContinuitySenior management ensures that FSI has the ability to recover and resume RDC operations to meet customer service requirements when an unexpected disruption occurs. Internal ProceduresThe bank maintains procedures internally to adequately administer and facilitate the remote deposit and cash management services.There are currently 96 RDC customers, which represent a15.66% increase in RDC customers from last assessment period, with a total transaction volume of $627,447,476.29, which represents an increase of 9.92% from last assessment period.

There have been no SARs filed during the assessment period as result of unusual or suspicious activity surrounding the use of RDC services.ACHJ. Wallace acts as both an Originating Depository Financial Institutions (“ODFI”) and a Receiving Depository Financial Institution (“RDFI”). The ODFI and RDFI are required to establish, monitor and periodically review exposure limits for each of its approved originators and beneficiaries. It also must examine compliance with this requirement on an ongoing basis through its internal audit process. Customers may be in a corporate form of legal organization, may be Partnerships of various types or may be municipalities. These payments are automatically debited and/or credited from/to a customer’s account on the payment effective date of the file.

Therefore an increase in ACH activity will not have an adverse effect on its risk rating.Brokered DepositsThe Board of Directors of J. Wallace Bank promotes the maintenance of effective controls to ensure the liquidity needs of the institution will be met. The Board considers the prudent use of brokered funds to be a permissible liquidity source. Brokered deposits are defined as all deposits directly or indirectly obtained through deposit brokers.As per FFIEC guidance, J. Wallace generally does not accept deposit brokers:Who are not known to Oritani;Conduct business or obtain deposits outside of the United States;Are unable to provide reference(s) from reputable banks;Provide other services that appear suspicious or may create the appearance of impropriety;Refuse to cooperate and provide material information during the due diligence process;Use technology or engage in behavior that would provide anonymity to customers. The Board has appointed the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), under the general direction of the Board, to implement and administer the brokered deposit funding program. The Board of Directors will annually review and approve brokered deposit funding program policy. The CFO will recommend changes to it as appropriate for review and approval of the Board.Risk ManagementThe Chief Risk Officer must evaluate and approve the use of brokered deposits. Risks associated with the use of brokered deposits include liquidity, interest rate, transaction, reputation and compliance risk.Liquidity RiskLiquidity risk refers to the risk to earnings or capital that arises from the bank’s inability to meet its obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses. Management mitigates this risk by limiting the bank’s exposure to the use of brokered deposits. The risk is also limited by the substantial capital position the bank currently enjoys. Interest Rate RiskInterest rate (market) risk is the risk to a bank’s condition resulting from adverse movements in market rates or prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates or equity prices. This type of risk focuses on the economic scenarios relative to the value of the Bank in the current interest rate environment and the sensitivity of that value to changes in interest rates. A thorough analysis will be conducted prior to commitment to a brokered deposit contract including rate, fees, and duration of said contract. Limits to the use of brokered deposits will be determined in this policy. The use of these funds will be reviewed by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.Transaction RiskTransaction risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from problems with service or product delivery and may include potential financial losses from human error or fraud, incomplete information and related decision-making or operation disruption. The risk is a function of the adequacy of internal control and information systems, employee integrity, management policies and operation processes. In order to mitigate transaction risk, due diligence will be conducted on all deposit brokers prior to entering into a relationship with them and on an annual basis thereafter. Management information systems will provide ease in monitoring and tracking the use of brokered deposits. The system will include a listing of funds obtained through each significant program, rates paid on each instrument, maturity information and concentrations. The concentration of brokered deposits will be prepared at least quarterly by the CFO and reviewed by the Board in the financial report. Further, the use of brokered deposits and the management of its function will be reviewed annually by the bank’s external auditors.Reputation RiskReputation risk is the potential that negative publicity regarding the Bank’s business practices, whether true or not, will impact our ability to raise brokered deposits. For this reason, bank management responsible for overseeing the brokered deposit program must be aware of any information that could affect the market’s or public’s perception of the soundness of the institution.Compliance RiskCompliance risk arises from violations of or nonconformance with those laws, regulations or prescribed practices that govern the Bank’s activities. There are two specific compliance concerns regarding brokered deposits- Capital Level Requirements and Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering compliance. FDIC requires an institution to be well capitalized in order to accept brokered deposits. The Bank only does business with deposit brokers who are registered with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). Brokers registered with the SEC are required to follow the same general CIP requirements as banking institutions and are periodically examined by the SEC for compliance.As of 06/30/2016, the bank has opened 4 Brokered deposit accounts totaling $12,269,656.11 and it is planned to increase these deposits during FYE 2017. While these deposits are considered High Risk, this risk is mitigated by the fact that we are only accepting time deposits and a limited amount of money market accounts. There will be no demand deposit accounts accepted. Brokered money market accounts will be subject to Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD).J.

LoansDuring the assessment period, the Bank experienced a $139,439,725.64 or a 20.86% increase in total loans for FYE 2016. The largest increase in terms of dollar value was in Commercial Loans totaling $52,724,523.26 or 9.37%. Commercial Loans has been an integral segment of the Bank’s lending focus.

The current customer safe deposit data is as follows:   CDARsJ. Wallace does not presently participate in The Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”) Reciprocal Program offered by Promontory Interfinancial Network, LLC. In the future, J. Wallace will take this program into consideration if there is sufficient demand and neutral costs. CDARS is a service that enables financial institutions to provide access to FDIC insurance on certificates of deposit investments of $50 million and above. All participants are regulated financial institutions. Should J. Wallace participate at a later date, the Bank places its own customer’s funds that are over the FDIC deposit insurance limit with CDARS and gets the matching funds back from CDARS. J. WALLACE would perform CIP/CDD on all customers and verify the source of funds on all deposits. New Products and ServicesIn addition to senior management and the Board of Directors approval, new products must be approved by the new product committee and BSA Officer dependent on apparent risk. During FYE 16 the following Retail products were introduced:Diamond Money Market – September 2015Westwood Business Money Markey AccountAs of May 4, 2016 J. Wallace Bank has joined Allpoint Network, which means J. Wallace Bank customers now have access to America’s largest surcharge-free ATM network, with some 55,000 surcharge-free ATMs worldwide.In addition to J. Wallace Bank’s branch locations and ATMs, with Allpoint Network, J. Wallace Bank customers will never be far away from surcharge-free ATM access to their cash, especially in the United States where Allpoint offers 43,000 cash machines in places they're already visiting as part of their daily routine. Conveniently located in destination retail outlets including major discount retailers, convenience, grocery and pharmacy stores, Allpoint Network ATMs save customers of J. Wallace Bank time in addition to ATM fees. Currency Transaction ReportingJ. WALLACE has established CTR recordkeeping and reporting policy and procedures. There have been some removals from the CTR Exemption List since FYE 2015 and stands at 6 customers. For FYE 2016 there were 2,529 Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) filed through FinCEN’s BSA E-Filing System. This is an increase of 151 or 6.35% over the 2,378 filed for FYE 2015. These reports are system prepared by Patriot Officer, reviewed by the branches where the transactions took place and then reviewed again and approved by the BSA Department before filing. The majority of these CTRs are for customers who do not qualify for exemptions because of the type of services they provide their customers, e.g. sell money orders or transfer funds for Western Union.CTRs Filed FYE 20162,529FYE 20152,378 1516.35%Suspicious Activity Transaction Monitoring Transaction Monitoring SoftwareSenior Management has determined that Global Vision System’s Patriot Officer (anti-money laundering solution) provides the most suitable solution for the bank. Based upon an established timeline, the new AML transaction monitoring system went live in the 2Q of 2014. The new AML transaction monitoring system strengthens the bank’s transaction monitoring capabilities, creates a more efficient and effective department and over time will reduce the department’s workload.Patriot Officer Automated Anti-Money Laundering System is used to detect suspicious activity that is occurring at, through or against the Bank. During the assessment period BSA placed more emphasis on determining customer high risk transactional activity from account opening on. This process requires an initial 90 day review of anticipated activity documented at account opening versus the actual activity. There is currently no automated system in place to perform the 90 day reviews and the manual process is time consuming and not adequate. Patriot Officer does have a module, Dynamic Risk Module, which will assist with this process at no additional cost for its use, however the Bank has not received training in how to best utilize it. It has been recommended the Bank investigate the implementation of this module with the proper setup and training directly from Global Vision or another third party consultant. J. Wallace will be migrated to a new transaction monitoring system, PRIME, effective 11/11/16. The new system will create increased efficiency in the daily operations as PRIME interfaces directly with the bank’s operating system Bankway. Patriot Officer and Bankway do not currently have an effective interface.Transaction Monitoring ResultsSARs filedBreakdown of Alerts by DepartmentFYE 2016116BSA Department73FYE 2015115Branch Administration3 +10.8%76For FYE 2016 there were 116 Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) filed with FinCEN compared with 115 for FYE 2015, an increase of 0.8%.During the assessment period there were 76 new suspicious activity alerts reported and investigated.

The BSA Officer, at the special request of the board, prepares an enhanced SAR report to identify specific patterns of suspicious activity.Crimes and Losses:Branch Robberies:During FYE 2016 there were no branch robberiesCheck, Reclamation, ATM, ACH and Debit Card Losses:For fiscal year 2016 (07/01/2015- 06/30/2016) J. Wallace Bank Cashier’s Checks continued to be counterfeited across the United States. In this scam, fraudsters would send a counterfeit J. Wallace Bank cashier’s check to persons buying/selling items on Craigslist or Online for jobs payments exceeding the amounts owed and request victims send remaining funds back to fraudster.  According to our records these counterfeit checks have, resulted in losses of $1,449,575.86 to victims outside of the J. Wallace Bank customer network.  t. Internally, J. Wallace Bank suffered one loss of $2,480 when a branch cashed one of these counterfeit J. Wallace Bank checks for a non-customer.Additional losses included fraudulent provisional credits and late ACH notifications resulting in a total loss of $4,550.92. For fiscal year 2016 (07/01/2015- 06/30/2016) there were reclamation losses of $3,615.84 with no recoveries. Reclamations losses were the result of returned funds to the US Treasury for benefits received for joint owner accounts and the funds were withdrawn before the reclamation was received. Collection efforts have been unsuccessful.  For fiscal year 2016 (07/01/2015- 06/30/2016) there were 123 claims of fraudulent ATM or debit card transactions totaling $30,951.53. We recovered $10,939.resulting in net losses of $20,012.36. The majority of the fraud claim loses were debit card numbers stolen with fraudulent cards reproduced and are signature based transactions. EBanking uses 3 separate 3rd party neural programs to detect and prevent fraud. When potential fraud is detected, customer contact is attempted and cards are closed down as warranted.The Deposit Operations Department is now using an automated Check Fraud Detection System (ASV) that is integrated with the FIS core processing system. The main features of this system compares signatures on checks from preciously received items, detects checks out of sequence, compares the check stock and duplicate checks (numbers) received. Internal Theft / Embezzlement:During FYE 2016 there was no branch Internal Theft or Embezzlement Identity Theft and Data Base Breaches:During FYE 2016 there were three (3) attempted Identity Thefts of customer’s information: 1-Branch notified security customer provided personal information to a person over the telephone. A subsequent unauthorized transfer of $1,000.00 from the customer's saving account to the customer's checking account was made. Branch Manager placed both accounts in a Frozen Status. Customer will close both account and open new ones on 12/16/2015 after a direct deposit is received on that date. 2-Customer alerted Branch that he received a phone call from an IRS scammer; he believed the scammer either had his social security number or customer furnished it to him. Customer is 85 years of age and does not wish to come to the branch and open a new account. Fraud Alert and Customer Comment placed in the CIF in Bankway. 3-A person contacted a Branch claiming to be a customer and had her Social Security number and asked for her account balance. Branch employee knows customer's voice and suspected it was not her and did not release any information. Branch contacted customer, who confirmed she did not make the call to the branch. Fraud alert added to customer CIP- Special Instructions added to all customer accounts. No Data Base Breaches during FYE 2016.The Bank did have 2 reports filed concerning Terrorist Financing in 2007 and 2008 that resulted in Subpoenas from the United States District Court / FBI. We filed one report for possible Terrorist Financing in 2010 and notified FinCEN’s Hotline and the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force. It was based on transactions taking place by a customer in the Middle East. Nothing was heard from the authorities and the activity ceased. There has been no other activity detected since then related to possible terrorist financing. SAR CommitteeThe SAR Review Committee consists of the: Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer; Senior Vice President & Chief Compliance Officer; and, if required, the President & Chief Executive Officer.If both the EVP and SVP do not concur with the BSA Officer’s recommendation the President will make the final decision.A recommendation can made be made by the BSA Officer to the Committee to terminate an account relationship after any SAR is filed if the BSA Officer believes continuing the relationship would be detrimental to the Bank. This would include a possible financial loss or potential harm to the bank’s reputation or a conflict of interest.After four (4) consecutive SARs are filed for the same customer for the same activity a customer will be referred to the Committee for action including the termination of their account relationship(s).ExceptionRegardless of the number of SARs filed an account relationship may be maintained upon request of a Law Enforcement Agency during the course of an investigation. For the assessment period, all recommendations by the BSA Officer to terminate a client relationship have been fulfilled.Bank StaffingJ. Wallace had a moderate turnover rate of 10% in branch personnel (CSRs, tellers, and branch management). The Bank considered the stability and actions of its staff with regard to insider fraud. The Bank recognizes that federal crime statistics reflect that money laundering and terrorist financing activity through financial institutions can often be influenced or assisted by internal staff. The Bank has not experienced personnel fraud during the current assessment period and minimal terminations resulting from procedural violations. There were no reports of terminated staff involved in fraud, money laundering or terrorist financing activities. Additionally there were no incidents involving employee mismanagement of funds leading to a loss to the Bank.The increase of illicit employee activity and possible income loss of the bank creates a need for a Know Your Employee (“KYE”) policy to be implemented by the BSA Department. As a matter of policy the BSA Department will create the KYE policy as a standalone or part of the KYC policy.The shortage of front line personnel in the branch offices remains a factor this year. Branch Managers are staffed in each branch as opposed to the last assessment period where two branch managers were needed and the locations were run by experienced assistant branch managers. None of the branches are in need of customer service representatives and one is in need of a senior teller. The Bank makes an effort to staff all branches with managers, assistant managers and senior tellers with current employees who have knowledge of J. Wallace products and procedures. The overall frontline personnel vacancy rate is currently 10% and is concentrated in the teller area, an area of concern. Human Resources is actively seeking experienced replacements through outside recruitment. Based on the continued rate of front line personnel vacancies with offices located in High Crime and Drug Risk Areas the Risk Assessment will remain as Moderate.Branch Openings by location:BranchEmployees on FMLTotal Open PositionsHackensackN/A0Cliffside PkN/A2TeaneckN/A1Palisade PkN/A0Hohokus11Twp of WashingtonN/A2FairmountN/A0WCLN/A0PatersonN/A0North BergenN/A0Park RidgeN/A0FairviewN/A0ShalerN/A0New MilfordN/A1Ridgefield PkN/A0Central AvenueN/A1EmersonN/A0BergenfieldN/A2RamseyN/A2Upper MontclairN/A1CliftonN/A1BergenlineN/A3SummitN/A0MonasteryN/A1Grand N/A1Total PopulationN/A187Total Current OpeningsN/A19Total Vacancy Rate010%Total Vacancy Rate  Tellers-14%  Total Vacancy Rate Supervisors- 5%  At the conclusion of the assessment period there were no employee vacancies in the BSA, Wire Transfer, eBanking or Deposit Operations Departments.

Wallace customers are U.S. citizens & residents and small to mid-size domestic businesses. The Bank considered the nature of its customers and the type of account opening activity, longevity of accounts, and transitory nature of its customers.  In addition, the commercial lending department has expanded our market area to surrounding states. Customer RiskThe Bank has established a risk rating and monitoring frequency system to mitigate the risks associated with money laundering and terrorist financing activity. The BSA Department determines the risk rating on every type of account by reviewing new and/or existing account criteria.When a new account is opened the procedures in the Branch Administration Procedures –New Deposit Accounts will be followed using the ChexSystems (DDA only) and Bridger Insight (all accounts) on-line programs. In the event that a match is found an individual at the bank will follow the steps in the “Processing an OFAC Hit” section of these procedures.The Bank’s use of the Lexis/Nexis Bridger Insight automated system provides immediate results when verifying that new customers are or are not on the Government’s Specially Designated Nations (SDN) or Palestinian Legislative Council (NS-PLC) Lists or any of the other 25+ Watch Lists the system monitors. Updates to the SDN and NS-PLC lists are compared to the Bank’s customer base within five (5) business days after each time those lists are updated.Other DepartmentsLoan Accounts, wire transfers in and wire transfers out, requests for donations, all require that a check of the OFAC list is performed prior to completion of the transaction. In the event that a match is found, the department should follow the steps outlined below in “Processing an OFAC Hit”By assigning a risk rating and monitoring frequency, the BSA Department. is able to maintain control of unusual or high-risk account activity. This system allows the BSA Department to effectively manage accounts and identify those accounts that may require enhanced due diligence (EDD).There are no overseas borrowers and all loan collateral is located in the U.S.A.The BSA team checks on OFAC compliance every time FinCEN publishes an update (usually daily) and reviews on-going OFAC screening results weekly.Customer profiles may change over time and it is important that a periodic review be performed so that risk rating and monitoring frequency reflects the risk profile of the relationship. Reviews by the BSA Department determine if the risk factors have significantly changed and whether a more appropriate risk rating and or monitoring frequency should be assigned.When a customer relationship is reviewed, it is important to review all factors including, but not limited to customer type, transactional activity, and volume or amount of transactions that influence the risk rating.Overseas Branches / Correspondent Accounts with Foreign BanksJ. Wallace is a Northeast US regional bank and as such does not have or maintain any foreign branches or foreign correspondent bank accounts.Electronic BankingJ.

Signed and dated by customer Despite the decrease in NRA accounts our risk exposure remains Moderate.International TransactionsThe Bank considered the nature of fund transfer activity including customers, locations, frequency, and currency amounts. No transfers are performed for non-customers and foreign wire transfers for customers are performed on an incoming basis only. All wire transfers are also entered manually through FSI’s Patriot Officer Wire Transfer Module. This enables staff to ensure all Foreign Wire Transfers received through US correspondent financial institutions are entered as Foreign Wires in the system. Wire transfers are monitored through the Patriot Officer Anti-Money Laundering System.  The Bank performs OFAC / Watch List Checks for all parties named on outgoing wire transfers which would include the receiving financial institution, beneficiary and any other individual or entity named in the wire transfer instructions before the wire transfer is processed. International Wire TransferThe Wire Transfer Department was transferred from the Accounting Department to the eBanking Department during the previous assessment period with its personnel.

Wallace has no communications from OFAC indicating compliance problems, and no history of OFAC violations, with a small number of transactions occurring in high risk jurisdictions relative to the transaction population. As such our inherent risk remains MODERATE.The purpose of the OFAC program is to completely comply with OFAC regulations, and to help ensure no funds are transferred into or out of accounts blocked in accordance with OFAC sanctions.J. Wallace Bank originates wire transfers, issues Official Checks, sells Travelers Checks and Gift Checks. The OFAC list is checked when the receiver of funds is not a customer to ensure that no transactions of any type are completed for entities that appear on the OFAC List. ACH activity is monitored on a daily basis with reports provided by Lexis/Nexis and FSI. OFAC searches on the originators are performed for all of these transactions.J. Wallace Bank has compliance procedures in place so that we are able to react to frequent changes to the sanction lists, and can identify accounts or transactions that would be subject to the sanctions, resulting in blocking, freezing, rejecting and reporting funds.Total compliance with OFAC sanctions requires a great deal of information, some of which may need to be obtained with legal assistance. Our procedures have been developed with this in mind, and do not address specific issues with specific governments or entities.

We have implemented a process by which we continuously identify and monitor the risks that could directly impact the quality of our BSA/AML compliance program.  By analyzing and understanding our BSA/AML risk profile, we have been able to apply appropriate risk management processes to, and controls within, the BSA/AML compliance program to mitigate risk.  Board OversightThe Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for ensuring the bank maintains an effective BSA/AML program. As a result, management is required to develop policies and procedures designed to limit and reasonably control BSA/AML risks identified in the risk assessment.   The Board is also responsible for designating a qualified BSA/AML Compliance Officer to oversee daily compliance. This designation must be made by formal Board resolution at least annually and noted within the minutes of the meeting in which the designation is made.  The Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring that the BSA Officer has sufficient authority and resources to administer an effective BSA/AML Program based on the bank’s risk profile.BSA/AML Compliance Program ComponentsAs required by law, our BSA/AML compliance program must be written, approved by the Board of Directors and noted in the Board minutes.  We must have a BSA/AML compliance program that is commensurate with our risk profile.  Our BSA/AML compliance program must be fully implemented and reasonably designed to meet BSA requirements.  We acknowledge that policy statements alone are not sufficient; our practices must coincide with our written policies, procedures and processes.  Our BSA/AML compliance program must provide for the following minimum requirements, also referred to as the “pillars” of BSA:A system of internal controls to ensure ongoing compliance.Independent testing of BSA/AML compliance.Designation of an individual or individuals responsible for managing BSA compliance (i.e. BSA Officer).Training for appropriate personnel.Additionally, we must include a Customer Identification Program as part of our BSA/AML compliance program.  BSA/AML Risk AssessmentWe acknowledge the value in establishing a comprehensive risk assessment to aid us in applying appropriate risk management processes to, and controls within, our BSA/AML compliance program with the objective of mitigating that risk.  We also acknowledge that the risk assessment process has helped us in identifying and mitigating gaps in our controls.  In the 2Q2016, we undertook an initiative to overhaul the existing BSA/AML risk assessment to ensure that our resulting BSA/AML risk assessment is representative of our BSA/AML risk as presented by our operations, markets, customer base, products, services and risk management practices.  Based on the information analyzed within our risk assessment, we have identified our BSA/AML risk profile to be moderate.  We also acknowledge that our risks will change as we implement new products and services, enter new markets, take on new customers and make changes operationally and strategically. As such, we have committed to maintaining a dynamic risk assessment that is proactively updated for any changes that could impact the bank’s risk profile.Internal Control RequirementsThe Board, acting through Senior Management, is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the bank maintains an effective BSA/AML internal control structure, including suspicious activity monitoring and reporting.  Internal controls are our policies, procedures and processes designed to limit and control risks and to achieve compliance with the BSA.  The following table highlights internal control requirements and the actions we have taken to ensure we have implemented satisfactory controls. Internal controls should:[Insert Financial Institution Here] BSA/AML INTERNAL CONTROL STRUCTURE☒Identify banking operations more vulnerable to abuse by money launderers and criminals; provide for periodic updates to the bank’s risk profile; and, provide for a BSA/AML compliance program tailored to manage risks.☒Inform the Board, or appropriate subcommittee, and Senior Management of compliance initiatives, identified compliance deficiencies, and corrective actions taken, and notify directors and senior management of SARs filed.☒Identify a person or persons responsible for BSA/AML compliance.☒Provide for program continuity despite changes in management or employee composition or structure.☒Meet all regulatory recordkeeping and reporting requirements, meet recommendations for BSA/AML compliance and provide for timely updates in response to changes in regulations.  ☒Implement risk-based CDD policies, procedures and processes.☒Identify reportable transactions and accurately file all required reports including SARs, CTRs and CTR exemptions.  ☒Provide for dual controls and the segregation of duties to the extent possible.☒Provide sufficient controls and systems for filing CTRs and CTR exemptions.☒Provide sufficient controls and monitoring systems for timely detection and reporting of suspicious activity.☒Provide for adequate supervision of employees that handle currency transactions, complete reports grant exemptions monitor for suspicious activity or engage in any other activity covered by the BSA and its implementing regulations.☒Incorporate BSA compliance into the job descriptions and performance evaluations of bank personnel, as appropriate.☒Train employees to be aware of their responsibilities under the BSA regulations and internal policy guidelines.  Independent Testing RequirementsUnder the pillars of BSA, we are required to ensure independent testing of the adequacy of our BSA/AML compliance program is conducted every 12-18 months. We acknowledge that our risk profile, driven by our products, services, customer base and markets, presents elevated BSA/AML risk and as such, it is the policy of [Insert Financial Institution Here] to engage an independent third party to conduct the bank’s BSA/AML audit every 12 months, at a minimum.  It should be noted that two independent testing functions support one another in this endeavor:  one audit assesses the adequacy of the bank’s BSA/AML compliance program over the “core” bank, while a second audit, performed by a separate independent third party, assesses the adequacy of our BSA/AML controls over the bank’s prepaid card function.  The independent third parties performing such audits are subject to the bank’s vendor management process.  We have laid out the following, in accordance with regulatory guidance, as minimum requirements for our BSA/AML independent testing process:[Insert Financial Institution Here] BSA/AML INDEPENDENT TESTING REQUIREMENTS☒An evaluation of the overall adequacy and effectiveness of the BSA/AML compliance program, including policies, procedures and processes. We require an explicit statement about the BSA/AML compliance program’s overall effectiveness and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.  ☒A review of the bank’s risk assessment for reasonableness given our risk profile.☒Appropriate risk-based transactional testing to verify our bank’s adherence to the BSA recordkeeping and reporting requirements.☒An evaluation of management’s efforts to resolve violations and deficiencies noted in previous audits and regulatory examinations, including progress in addressing outstanding supervisory actions.☒A review of staff training for adequacy, accuracy and completeness.☒A review of the effectiveness of our suspicious activity monitoring systems.☒An assessment of our process for identifying and reporting suspicious activity, including a review of filed or prepared SARs to determine their accuracy, timeliness, completeness and effectiveness of our policy.☒An assessment of the integrity and accuracy of MIS used in the BSA/AML compliance program, including reports used to identify large currency transactions, aggregate daily currency transactions, funds transfer transactions, monetary instrument sales and analytical and trend reports.We require that the audit scope, procedures performed, transactional testing completed and findings from the review be defined and documented.  All audit documentation and work papers are available for examiner review.  Any violations, policy or procedure exceptions or other deficiencies are outlined within an audit report that is provided to the Board upon completion of the audit.  BSA Officer ResponsibilitiesThe Board recognizes its responsibility to designate a qualified individual to serve as our bank’s BSA Compliance Officer.  The BSA Compliance Officer is responsible for coordinating and monitoring daily BSA/AML compliance.  The BSA Officer is also charged with managing all aspects of the BSA/AML compliance program and with managing the bank’s adherence to the BSA and its implementing regulations. The Board has designated a BSA Officer at the executive level who is responsible for daily oversight of the bank’s core and prepaid card BSA compliance programs.  The BSA Officer is supported by an Assistant BSA Officer.Both the BSA Officer and Assistant BSA Officer maintain certifications through the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists and are expected to fulfill continuing education requirements to maintain these certifications and remain knowledgeable of BSA/AML requirements, emerging risks, and areas of regulatory concern.The BSA Officer must provide quarterly reports to the Board of Directors that address the following, at a minimum:Strengths and weaknesses within our BSA/AML program.Results of our most recent independent audit(s).Reports filed during the quarter.Changes in our bank’s risk profile, including recommendations for change and/or updates to our BSA/AML risk assessment or policy.Adequacy of resources, in terms of staffing, training and/or technology needs.  Training RequirementsOngoing and meaningful training is critical to effectively comply with the BSA and its supporting laws and regulations, as well as with our BSA/AML compliance program.  On an annual basis, we provide for classroom-style BSA training for our staff during the bank’s all-employee in-service day. For this training, staff is divided into areas of responsibility and BSA training content is tailored to those groups.  Senior Management also participates in these annual staff training sessions.  As noted within this policy, the BSA Officer and Assistant BSA Officer are expected to fulfill continuing education requirements to maintain ACAMS certifications and to remain knowledgeable of BSA/AML requirements, emerging risks, and areas of regulatory concern. Resources have been allotted to ensure these requirements are met.  The Board acknowledges that it must remain knowledgeable of BSA requirements and emerging issues. As such, resources have been dedicated to ensure the Board receives BSA compliance training annually, at a minimum.  [Insert Financial Institution Here]’s BSA/AML training initiatives are documented. Training and testing materials, dates of training sessions and attendance records are maintained by the bank’s Human Resources Officer and are available for examiner review.The Money Laundering ProcessIn order to fully understand the purpose behind the practices and procedures incorporated in our BSA/AML compliance program, we must have an understanding of the money laundering process.  Money laundering is the criminal practice of processing ill-gotten gains or “dirty” money, through a series of transactions. In this way, funds are “cleaned” so that they appear to be proceeds from legal activities.  Money laundering generally does not involve currency at every stage of the laundering process. Although money laundering is a diverse and often complex process, it basically involved three independent steps that can occur simultaneously.Placement:  The first and most vulnerable stage of money laundering.  The goal is to introduce the unlawful proceeds into the financial system without attracting the attention of financial institutions or law enforcement.  Placement techniques include structuring currency deposits in amounts to evade reporting requirements or commingling currency deposits of legal and illegal enterprises.  Examples may include:  dividing large amounts of currency into less conspicuous smaller sums that are deposited directly into a bank account, depositing a refund check from a cancelled vacation or insurance policy, or purchasing a series of monetary instruments that are collected and then deposited into accounts at another location or financial institutions.  Layering:  Involved moving funds around the financial system, often in a complex series of transactions to create confusion and complicate the paper trail.  Examples may include:  exchanging monetary instruments for larger or smaller amounts, or wiring or transferring funds to and through numerous accounts in or more financial institutionsIntegration:  Once the funds are in the financial system and insulated through the layering stage, the integration stage is used to create the appearance of legality through additional transactions.  These transactions further shield the criminal from recorded connection to the funds by providing a plausible explanation for the source of funds. Examples may include:  the purchase and resale of real estate, investment securities, foreign trusts or other assetsAdditionally, we must understanding indications and risks of terrorist financing.  The motivation behind terrorist financing is ideological as opposed to profit-seeking, which is generally the motivation for most crimes associated with money laundering.  Terrorism is intended to intimidate a population or to compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any specific act through the threat of violence.  Terrorist groups develop sources of funding that are relatively mobile to ensure that funds can be used to obtain material and other logistical items needed to commit terrorist acts.  As such, money laundering is often a vital component on terrorist financing.  Terrorists generally finance their activities through both unlawful and legitimate sources.  Unlawful activities, such as extortion, kidnapping and narcotics trafficking, have been found to be a major source of funding.  Other observed activities involve smuggling, fraud, theft, robbery, identity theft and use of conflict diamonds as well as the improper use of charitable or relief funds.  In the last case, donors may have no knowledge that their donations have been diverted to support terrorist causes.  It is crucial that we also address and understand elder financial exploitation. We can play a critical role in addressing elder financial exploitation through our knowledge of our customers and their accounts.  We may become aware of persons or entities perpetrating illicit activity against the elderly through monitoring transaction activity that is not consistent with expected behavior.  [Insert Financial Institution Here] Bank may also become aware of such scams through our direct interactions with our customers who are being financially exploited.  If we observe possible elder abuse red flags, we must contact the BSA Officer. The BSA Officer is then required to review the circumstance of the situation and determine whether a SAR filing may be warranted.  Customer Identification Program OverviewWe are required by law to have a written Customer Identification Program (CIP).  Our CIP is intended to enable us to form a reasonable belief that we know the true identities of our customers.  Our CIP must include account opening procedures that specify the identifying information we obtain from each customer.  We must also include reasonable and practical risk-based procedures for verifying the identity of each customer.  Under the CIP rule, an “account” is a formal banking relationship to provide or engage in services, dealings or other financial transactions and includes a deposit account, a transaction or asset account, a credit account or another extension of credit. An account also includes a relationship established to provide a safe deposit box or other safekeeping service or to provide cash management, custodian or trust services.  An account does not include:Products or services for which a formal banking relationship is not established with a person, such as check cashing, funds transfer or the sale of a check or money order.Any account that the bank acquires. This may include single or multiple accounts as a result of a purchase of assets, acquisition, merger or assumption of liabilities.Account opened to participate in an employee benefit plan established under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.  The CIP rule applies to a “customer”.  A customer is a person (an individual, corporation, partnership, trust, estate or any other entity recognized as a legal person) who opens a new account, an individual who opens a new account for another individual who lacks legal capacity and an individual who opens a new account for any entity that is not a legal person.  A customer does not include a person who does not receive banking services, such as a person whose loan application is denied. CIP | Documents Required for IndividualsAt a minimum, we must obtain the following identifying information from each customer before opening an account:NameDate of birthAddressIdentification numberFor an individual who does not have a residential or business street address, an Army Post Office (APO) or Fleet Post Office (FPO) box number, or the residential street address of the next of kin or of another contact individual may be accepted.For a non-U.S. person, one or more of the following must be obtained:TIN.Passport number and country of issuance.Alien identification card number.Number and country of issuance of any other government-issued document evidencing nationality or residence and bearing a photograph or similar safeguard.Identifying documents used to verify our customers’ identities must provide evidence of a customer’s nationality or residence and bear a photograph or similar safeguard.  We must obtain an unexpired, photo ID (e.g. driver’s license, passport, state-issued photo ID, resident alien card). CIP | Documents Required for Businesses At a minimum, we must obtain the following identifying information from each customer before opening an account:NameAddress (principal place of business, local office or other physical location)Identification number (including Amish)For a person other than an individual, such as a corporation, partnership or trust, we must obtain documents showing the legal existence of the entity, such as certified articles of incorporation, an unexpired government-issued business license, a partnership agreement or a trust instrument.CIP | Non-Documentary Verification MethodsWe are not required to use non-documentary methods to verify a customer’s identity. However, in cases in which a customer may not have documents to satisfy our documentary identification methods, we may utilize non-documentary methods to verify a customer’s identity.  We may contact the customer; independently verify a customer’s identity through the comparison of information provided by the customer with information obtained from a consumer reporting agency, public database or other source; check references with other financial institutions; or, obtain a financial statement.  The following situations may occur in the normal course of business. Please note [Insert Financial Institution Here]’s procedure for addressing each situation. Note:  e-Funds queries are made for all new customers. For loan accounts, credit reports are obtained for all new customers.SITUATIONS IN WHICH NON-DOCUMENTARY VERIFICATION METHODS MAY BE USEDDescription of Situation[Insert Financial Institution Here] ProcedureAn individual is unable to present an unexpired government-issued identification document that bears a photograph or similar safeguardWe are not familiar with the documents presentedThe account is opened without obtaining documents (e.g. we obtain required information from the customer with the intent to verify it)The customer opens the account without appearing in personWe are otherwise presenting with circumstances that increase the risk that we will be unable to verify the true identity of a customer through documentsFor accounts opened online, we utilize e-Funds and/or a credit report to verify the customer’s identity.  We then follow up with customer contact to verify that the information provided is accurate.  For non-individuals, we obtain financial statements, business credit reports and perform customer contact.CIP | Additional Identification Procedures for Specific CustomersThere are situations where we obtain information about individuals with authority or control over an account, including signatories, in order to verify a customer’s identity.  This verification method applies only when we cannot verify the customer’s true identity through documentary or non-documentary methods.  For example, we may need to obtain information about and verify the identity of a sole proprietor or the principals in a partnership when we cannot otherwise satisfactorily identify the sole proprietor or the partnership.We will obtain CIP information on signatories for new accounts opened by entities, and if the risk warrants, we will verify their identity using established verification methods.For our Amish customers who do not maintain photo ID, we have established an alternative method to verify their identities.  We will accept a letter from the community’s Bishop attesting to the identity of our Amish customer who is requesting to open an account with [Insert Financial Institution Here].  Please note that the Amish customer must provide a TIN at the time of account opening.CIP | Circumstances under which the Bank should Not Open an AccountWhen identification verification procedures do not result in a reasonable belief of the true identity of the customer, the account should not be opened.  CIP | ExceptionsExcluded from the definition of customer (and therefore excluded from CIP) are federal regulated banks, banks regulated by a state bank regulator, governmental entities and publicly traded companies.  Instead of obtaining a TIN from a customer prior to opening an account, an account may be opened without a taxpayer identification number where the customer has applied for, but has not yet received a taxpayer identification number.  Where this exception is utilized, a copy of the TIN application must be made and kept with the other account opening documentation.  The account should be flagged for review to ensure that the TIN was received within a reasonable time.  Generally, this time should not exceed 6-8 weeks from the time of account opening.  During this timeframe, the customer may have use of the account. If the TIN has not been received within this time period, customer contact should be made to determine its status. If the TIN is not forthcoming after contacting the customer, or if the bank has received notification that a TIN will not be issued, the account must be closed.  CIP | When the Bank Should File a SARWhen an account is declined or closed due to the inability to verify the customer’s identity, the BSA Officer must be contacted to determine whether a SAR should be filed.  Similarly, the BSA Officer should be notified of any unusual or suspicious identification documents or behaviors (e.g. reluctance to provide required information) observed at the time of account opening to determine whether a SAR should be filed. CIP | Comparison with Government ListsOur CIP must include procedures for determining whether a customer appears on any federal government list of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations.  We are contacted by the U.S. Treasury in consultation with the FDIC when a list is issued.  At that time, we must compare customer names against the list within a reasonable time of account opening or earlier, if required by the government, and as must also follow any directives that accompany the list.  As of the date of this policy, there are no designated government lists to verify specifically for CIP purposes.  Customer comparisons to Office of Foreign Assets Control lists and 314(a) requests remain separate and distinct requirements.CIP | Providing Customer NoticeWe must provide customers with adequate notice that we will request information to verify their identities.  The notice must describe our identification requirements and we must provide the notice in a manner that is reasonably designed to allow a customer to view it or otherwise receive the notice before an account is opened.  The content of our CIP Notice has been provided as Exhibit A to this policy.CIP | Reliance on another Financial InstitutionWe are permitted to rely on another financial institution to perform some or all of the elements of the CIP as long as the following criteria are met:The relied-upon financial institution is subject to a rule implementing AML program requirements and is regulated by a federal functional regulator.The customer has an account or is opening an account at the bank and at the other functionally regulated institution.Reliance is reasonable under the circumstances.The other financial institution enters into a contract requiring it to certify annually to the bank that is has implemented its AML program and it will perform (or its agent will perform) the specified requirements of the bank’s CIP.CIP | Use of Third PartiesThe CIP rule does not alter our authority to use a third party, such as an agent or service provider, to perform services on our behalf.  We are permitted to arrange for a third party, such as a car dealer or mortgage broker, acting as our agent in connection with ah loan, to verify the identity of our customer.  We can also arrange for a third party to maintain our records.  However, with any other responsibility performed by a third party, we are ultimately responsible for that third party’s compliance with our CIP requirements.  This requirement contrasts with the reliance provision of the CIP rule that permits the relied-upon party to take responsibility. Accounts may be opened by a third party, such a prepaid card program manager or IPI investment products.  In these instances, photo ID must be obtained, reviewed and documented for individuals.  Additional verification is performed through credit reports, e-Funds, or a telephone call.  For non-individuals, third parties must obtain articles of incorporation, government issued business licenses, partnership agreements, trust agreements, or certificates of good standing.   CIP | Record RetentionAt a minimum, we must retain the identifying information (name, address, date of birth for an individual, TIN and any other information required by the CIP) obtained at account opening for a period of 5 years after an account is closed. For credit cards, the retention period if 5 years after the account closes or becomes dormant.  We must also keep a description of the following for 5 years after the record was made:Any document that was relied upon to verify identity, noting the type of document, the identification number, the place of issuance and, if any, the date of issuance and expiration date.The method and results of any measures undertaken to verify identity.The results of any substantive discrepancy discovered when verifying identity.Customer Due DiligenceOur BSA/AML compliance program must include the adoption and implementation of comprehensive CDD policies, procedures and processes for all customers, particularly those who present higher risk for money laundering and terrorist financing. We must also include enhanced CDD for higher-risk customers and ongoing due diligence of our customer base.  CDD policies, procedures and processes are critical because they can aid us in:Detecting and reporting unusual or suspicious transactions that potentially expose the bank to financial loss, increased expenses or reputational risk.Avoiding criminal exposure from persons who use or attempt to use the bank’s products and services for illicit purposes.Adhering to safe and sound banking practices.CDD | Identifying Beneficial OwnersIn May 2016, FinCEN issued Customer Due Diligence Requirements for Financial Institutions.  The final rule amends existing rules to explicitly reference key elements of customer due diligence and set forward minimum standards for CDD that are believed to be fundamental to an effective anti-money laundering program.  The rule becomes effective on July 11, 2016 and its requirements must be implemented by May 11, 2018.  Under this rule, we must identify and verify the identity of beneficial owners of all legal entity customers at the time a new account is opened.  We verify the identity of the individuals identified as beneficial owners – NOT his or her status as a beneficial owner.  We are required to establish and maintain written policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify and verify the identities of beneficial owners of legal entity customers.  FinCEN is NOT imposing a categorical retroactive requirement. A beneficial owner is he natural person (as opposed to another legal entity). To aid in the determination of who meets the definition of a beneficial owner, FinCEN has provided for a two-prong test.  Each prong is intended to be an independent test.In cases where an individual is both a 25% owner and meets the definition for control, that same individual could be identified as a beneficial owner under both prongs.  You may also identify other individuals that technically fall outside the proposed definition of “beneficial owner” in accordance with your risk mitigation and customer due diligence practices.  Exclusions to the beneficial ownership rule include:  Financial institutions regulated by a Federal functional regulator or a bank regulated by a State bank regulatorA department or agency of the United States, of any State, or of any political subdivision of a StateAny entity established under the laws of the United States, of any State, or of any political subdivision of any State, or under an interstate compact between two or more states, that exercises governmental authority on behalf of the U.S. or of any such State or political subdivisionAny entity (other than a bank)) whose common stock or analogous equity interests are listed on the New York, American or NASDAQ stock exchangesAny entity organized under the laws of the United States or any State at least 51% of whose common stock or analogous equity interests are held in a listed entity.An issuer of a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or that is required to file reports under Section 15(d) of that ActAn investment company, as defined in Section 3 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, that is registered with the SEC under that ActAn investment adviser, as defined in Section 2022(a)(11) of the  Investment Advisors Act of 1940 that is registered with the SEC under that ActAn exchange or clearing agency, as defined in Section 3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that is registered under Section 6 or 17A of that ActAny other entity registered with the SEC under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934A registered entity, commodity pool operators, commodity trading advisor, retail foreign exchange dealer, swap dealer, or major swap participant, each as defined in Section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act that is registered with the CFTCA public accounting firm registered under Section 102 of the Sarbanes-Oxley ActA bank holding company, as defined in Section 2 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 or a savings or loan holding company as defined in Section 10(n) of the Home Owners’ Loan ActA pooled investment vehicle that is operated or advised by a financial institution excluded from the ruleAn insurance company that is regulated by a StateA financial market utility designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council under Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010A foreign financial institution established in a jurisdiction where the regulator of such institution maintains beneficial ownership information regarding such institutionNon-excluded pooled investment vehiclesIntermediated account relationshipsA non-U.S. governmental department, agency or political subdivision that engages only in governmental rather than commercial activities (As in the case of other legal entities lacking significant equity interests, financial institutions would be expected to collect beneficial ownership information under the control prong only)Any legal entity only to the extent that it opens a private banking account subject to 31 CFR 1010.620Non-profit entities whether or not tax exempt (from the ownership prong).  For purposes of this provision, a non-profit corporation or similar entity would include, among others, charitable, non-profit, not-for-profit, non-stock, public benefit or similar corporationsAccounts established for the purchase and financing of postage and for which payments are remitted directly by the financial institution to the provider of the postage products **Commercial accounts to financial insurance premiums and for which payments are remitted directly by the financial institution to the insurance provider or broker **Accounts to finance the purchase or lease of equipment and for which payments are remitted directly by the financial institution to the vendor or lessor of the equipment ****   The three exemptions directly above are subject to further limitations to mitigate the remaining limited money laundering risks associated with them. (Refer to Page 22 of the Final rule for details)The CDD Rule requires us to obtain information about the beneficial owners of a legal entity from the individual seeking to open a new account on behalf of the legal entity customer.  This individual could, but would not necessarily, be a beneficial owner. Please refer to the Beneficial Ownership Account Opening Procedures to guide you through the account opening process and the Customer Identification Program Procedures for information required to be obtained from each beneficial owner (i.e. CIP procedures for individuals) and acceptable documentary and non-documentary methods of verifying an individual’s identity.  We must use beneficial ownership information as we use other information we gather regarding customers, including compliance with OFAC-administered sanctions. As such, we must screen each beneficial owner against the OFAC list prior to account opening and/or disbursement of loan proceeds.FinCEN does not expect the information obtained under the CDD Rule to add additional 314(a) requirements.  The regulation implementing Section 314(a) does not require the reporting of beneficial ownership information associated with an account or transaction matching a named subject in a 314(a) request.  We are required to search our records for accounts or transactions matching a named subject and report whether a match exists using the identifying information provided in the request.  However, we have established as our policy, to include beneficial ownership in our investigation processes in addressing and responding to 314(a) requests [adjust this section if you policy is different].CDD | Determining a Customer’s Risk RatingAt the time of account opening, staff complete a workflow within our BSA software platform designed to address both CIP and CDD requirements.  The workflow walks account opening personnel through questions about a customer’s occupation or nature of business, purpose of the account, sources of funds and wealth, ownership control, domicile, anticipated account activity and other critical information that helps us to form an understanding about the customer and his/her/its anticipated relationship (and associated risk) with [Insert Financial Institution Here].  CDD | Responsibilities for Reviewing and Revising Customer Risk Ratings Customers rated High Risk at the time of account opening will be subject to an internal 60-day look-back to determine whether the high risk rating is appropriate given transaction activity conducted in the first three months of account opening.  A standard form has been developed to facilitate this look-back and document the assessment process.  This form is also utilized to perform monitoring of High and Moderate Risk Customers (i.e. those who have been identified as High or Moderate Risk based on ongoing monitoring, transaction activity, nature of business, etc.).  Criteria used to quantify risk and define/drive risk ratings has been outlined on the Customer Risk Assessment form.CDD | Enhanced Due Diligence for Higher-Risk CustomersCustomers who pose higher money laundering or terrorist financing risks present increased exposure to our bank.  Enhanced due diligence (EDD) for higher risk customers is especially critical in understanding their anticipated transactions and implementing a suspicious activity monitoring system that reduces our reputation, compliance and transaction risks.  Are noted above, customers that pose elevated risks (i.e. moderate and high risk customers) are subject to comprehensive periodic account reviews that are designed to ascertain whether transactions are reflective of the anticipated and “normal” activity for a given customer and whether there is any unusual or suspicious activity conducted during the timeframe reviewed.  Additionally, all customers are subject to ongoing behavior-based monitoring parameters within our BSA software platform.CDD for Lending RelationshipsExtensions of credit are incorporated into the bank’s behavior-based BSA monitoring system. [Insert bank process]  CDD | High Risk Banking FunctionsAs part of our BSA/AML risk assessment process, we reviewed all of our banking functions to determine those that present elevated BSA/AML risk.  The most prominent of such functions include online account opening and the prepaid card function.  Please refer to [Insert Financial Institution Here]’s BSA/AML risk assessment for complete details.Suspicious Activity Reporting We must have processes in place to identify, evaluate and report suspicious activity.  Suspicious activity reports (SARs) must be filed for:Criminal violations involving insider abuse in any amount.Criminal violations aggregating to $5,000 or more when a suspect can be identified.Criminal violations aggregating to $25,000 or more regardless of a potential suspect.Transactions conducted or attempted by, at or through the bank and aggregating to $5,000 or more if you know, suspect or have reason to suspect that the transaction involves illegal activity, is designed to evade reporting requirements or has no apparent lawful purpose.As SAR should also be filed when activity is inconsistent with an individual’s occupation, nature of business or does not reflect “normal” account activity.Mandatory SAR Reporting of Cyber-EventsWe are required to report a suspicious transaction conducted or attempted by, at or through the bank that involves or aggregates to $5,000 or more in funds or other assets.  If we suspect, or have reason to suspect that a cyber-event was intended, in whole or in part, to conduct, facilitate or affect a transaction or a series of transactions, it should be considered part of an attempt to conduct a suspicious transaction or series of transactions. In determining whether a cyber-event should be reported, we should consider all available information surrounding the cyber-event, including its nature and the information and systems targeted.  Similarly, to determine monetary amounts involved in the transactions or attempted transactions, we should consider in aggregate the funds and assets involved in or put at risk by the cyber event. When we report a cyber-event through a SAR, we should include, to the extent possible:Description and magnitude of the event.Known or suspected time, location and characteristics or signatures of the event.Indicators of compromise.Relevant IP addresses and their timestamps.Device identifiers.Methodologies used.Other information we believe is relevant.SAR Filing RequirementsSARs must be filed no later than 30 calendar days from the date of initial detection.  If no subject can be identified, the time period for filing is extended to 60 days.  The time period to file a SAR starts when we, in the course of our review or as a result of other factors, reach the conclusion that we know or have reason to suspect that activity meets one or more definitions of suspicious activity.  “Initial detection” should not necessarily be interpreted as meaning the moment a transaction is highlighted for review.  When a SAR is filed, we must review account activity for the subsequent 90 days following the filing to determine whether the suspicious activity has persisted. If suspicious activity has continued, we must file a SAR for continuous suspicious activity.  FinCEN guidance allows for an expanded filing deadline for continuous suspicious activity.  We may file SARs for continuous suspicious activity after a 90-day review, with the filing deadline being 120 days after the date of the previously related SAR.For situations requiring immediate attention, in addition to filing a timely SAR, we must immediately notify, by telephone, an “appropriate law enforcement authority” and, as necessary, our primary regulator.  For this initial notification, an appropriate law enforcement authority would generally be the local office of the IRS Criminal Investigation Unit or the FBI.  Notifying law enforcement of a suspicious activity does not relieve us of our obligation to file a SAR.Suspicious Activity Reporting Safe HarborFederal law provides protection from civil liability for all reports of suspicious transactions made to appropriate authorities, including supporting documentation regardless of whether such reports are filed pursuant to SAR instructions. Specifically, the law provides that a bank and its directors, officers, employees and agents that make a disclosure to the appropriate authorities of any possible violation of law or regulation, including a disclosure in connection with the preparation of SARs, “shall not be liable to any person under any law or regulation of the United States, any constitution, law or regulation of any State or political subdivision of any State, or under any contract or other legally enforceable agreement (including any arbitration agreement), for such disclosure or for any failure to provide notice of such disclosure to the person who is the subject of the such disclosure or any other person identified in the disclosure”.  The safe harbor applies to SARs filed with the required reporting thresholds as well as SARs filed voluntarily on any activity below required thresholds.  Systems to Identify, Research and Report Suspicious ActivitySuspicious activity monitoring and reporting are critical internal controls. Proper monitoring and reporting processes are essential to ensuring that the bank has an adequate and effective BSA compliance program.  Generally effective suspicious activity monitoring and reporting systems include 5 key components:  Identification or alert of unusual activity, which may include:  employee identification, law enforcement inquiries other referrals and transaction and surveillance monitoring system output.  Managing alerts.SAR decision-making.SAR completion and filing.Monitoring and SAR filing on continuous activity.These components are interdependent.  Breakdowns in any one or more of these components may adversely affect SAR reporting and BSA compliance.   Identification of Unusual ActivityWe use multiple methods to identify potentially suspicious activity, including but not limited to activity identified by employees during daily operations, law enforcement inquiries, advisories issued by regulatory or law enforcement agencies, transaction and surveillance monitoring system output or any combination of these methods.  Employee Identification:  During the course of daily operations, employees may observe unusual or potentially suspicious transaction activity.  [Insert Financial Institution Here] ensures bank staff receive BSA training annually, at a minimum, to ensure staff are knowledgeable of possible red flags] for suspicious activity.  [Describe escalation process Please refer to Appendix F of the FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual for examples of money laundering and terrorist financing “red flags”.Law Enforcement Inquiries and Requests:  We must maintain processes for identifying subjects of law enforcement requires, monitoring the transaction activity of those subjects when appropriate, identifying unusual or potentially suspicious activity related to those subjects and filing, as appropriate, SARs related to those subject.  Law enforcement inquiries and requests can include grand jury subpoenas, National Security Letters and section 314(a) requests.Mere receipt of any law enforcement inquiry does not, by itself, require the filing of a SAR by the bank. However, a law enforcement inquiry may be relevant to our customer and account risk assessments.  We should assess all the information we know about our customer, including the receipt of a law enforcement inquiry, in accordance with our BSA/AML compliance program.  We should determine whether a SAR should be filed based on all customer information available.  Managing AlertsAlert management focuses on processes used to investigate and evaluate identified unusual activity.  We must be aware of all methods of identification and should ensure our suspicious activity monitoring program includes processes to evaluate any unusual activity identified, regardless of the method of identification.  SAR Decision-Making ProcessAfter thorough research and analysis has been completed, findings are forwarded to [decision maker].  We have outlined the following escalation process from the point of initial detection to disposition of the investigation, as shown below.  [Describe escalation process]We document our decisions to file a SAR, including specific reasons for not filing a SAR as thorough documentation provides a record of or SAR decision-making process, including final decisions not to file a SAR.  [Describe documentation and where it is maintained]SAR Filing on Continuous ActivityOne purpose of filing SARs is to identify violations or potential violations of law to the appropriate law enforcement authorities for criminal investigation.  This objective is accomplished by the filing of a SAR that identifies the activity of concern.  If this activity continues out a period of time, such information should be made known to law enforcement and the federal banking agencies.  FinCEN guidance allows for an expanded filing deadline for continuous suspicious activity.  We may file SARs for continuous suspicious activity after a 90-day review, with the filing deadline being 120 days after the date of the previously related SAR. However, we may file SARs on continuing activity earlier than the 120-dy deadline if we believe the activity warranted earlier review by law enforcement.  This practice notifies law enforcement of the continuing nature of activity in aggregate.  In addition, this practice reminds us that we should continue to review the suspicious activity to determine whether other actions may be appropriate (e.g. terminating the relationship with the customer who is the subject of the filing).  Law enforcement may have an interest in ensuring certain accounts remain open notwithstanding suspicious or potential criminal activity in connection with those accounts. If a law enforcement agency requests that we maintain a particular account, we must ask for a written request.  The written request must indicate that the agency has requested that we maintain the account and the purpose and duration of the request.  Ultimately, however, the decision to maintain or close an account is ours.  As such, we have outlined the following escalation process for repeat SAR filings. [Describe escalation process]SAR Completion and FilingSAR completion and filing are a critical part of the SAR monitoring and reporting process.    [Describe process for SAR completion. Who is responsible for completing and filing SARs?  Is there an internal check to ensure narratives are adequate and that SARs are filed within regulatory timeframes?]Notifying the Board of SAR FilingsWe are required to notify the Board of Directors or an appropriate subcommittee, that SARs have been filed.  However, the regulations do not mandate a particular notification format.  We may, but are not required to, provide actual copies of SARs to the Board or a Board subcommittee. However, given the sensitivity of the information contained within SARs and liability for inadvertent or willing disclosure, we have opted to provide the Board summaries of SAR filings in general terms.  [What is the timeframe for reporting SARs to the Board?]Closing an Account Due to Continuous Suspicious ActivityWe may find it necessary to close an account due to continuing suspicious activity. Decisions to close an account due to ongoing continuous activity are subject to an escalation and decision-making process as outlined on the preceding pages.  Law enforcement may have an interest in ensuring certain accounts remain open notwithstanding suspicious or potential criminal activity in connection with those accounts. If a law enforcement agency requests that we maintain a particular account, we must ask for a written request.  The written request must indicate that the agency has requested that we maintain the account and the purpose and duration of the request.  Ultimately, however, the decision to maintain or close an account is ours.It is the responsibility of the Security Officer, the BSA Officer and the CEO to determine when it is prudent to close an account due to continuous suspicious activity.  Prohibition of SAR DisclosureNo bank, and no director, officer, employee or agent of a bank that reports a suspicious transaction may notify any person involved in the transaction that the transaction has been reported.  A SAR and any information that would reveal the existence of a SAR, as confidential, except as is necessary to fulfill BSA obligations and responsibilities.  For example, the existence or even the non-existence of a SAR must be kept confidential, as well as the information contained in the SAR to the extent the information would reveal the existence of a SAR.  Documentation of Circumstances in which SARs have been considered, but Not FiledAfter reviewing facts and circumstances, we may determine that a SAR filing is not warranted for activity flagged as possibly suspicious. In these cases, documentation is retained to support our decision not to file a SAR.  For each of these circumstances, we review the files 90 days after the decision not to file a SAR is made to determine whether possibly suspicious activity has continued.  Suspicious Activity Reporting Record RetentionWe must retain copies of SARs and supporting documentation for 5 years from the filing date.   We must provide all documentation supporting the filing a SAR upon request by FinCEN or an appropriate law enforcement or federal banking agency.  Currency Transaction ReportingWe must monitor for and report cash transactions in excess of $10,000 in one business day.  Total cash in and cash out must be considered. However, ins and outs are not combined; they are totaled separately.  Multiple transactions conducted on one business day will be aggregated to determine whether they exceed $10,000 and are therefore reportable.  Transactions include:  denomination exchanges, IRAs, deposits, withdrawals, loan payments, ATM transactions, purchases of CDs, exchanges, cash received for funds transfers, cash used to purchase monetary instruments, conversion of currency to prepaid access and transactions involving armored car services.  Aggregation of Currency TransactionsMultiple currency transactional totaling more than $10,000 during any on business day are treated as a single transaction if we have knowledge that they are by or on behalf of the same person. [Describe aggregation process] In cases where multiple businesses share a common owner, the presumption is that separately incorporated entities are independent persons.  The currency transactions of separately incorporated businesses should not automatically be aggregated as being on behalf of any one person simply because those businesses are owned by the same person.  We must determine whether multiple businesses that share a common owner are being operated independently.  If we determine that these businesses (or one or more of the businesses and the private accounts of the owner) are not operating separately or independently of one another or their common owner (e.g. the businesses are staffed by the same employees and are located at the same address, the bank accounts of one business are repeatedly used to pay the expenses of another business, or the business bank accounts are repeatedly used to pay the payroll expenses of the owner) we may determine that aggregating the businesses’ transactions is appropriate because the transactions were made on behalf of a single person.If we determine that the businesses are independent, we should not aggregate separate transactions for these businesses.   CTR Completion and FilingCTRs must be filed no later than 15 days after the transaction.  Currency Transaction Reporting ExemptionsThe Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994 established a two-phase exemption process. Under Phase I exemptions, transactions in currency by banks, governmental departments or agencies and listed public companies and their subsidiaries are exempt from reporting.  Under Phase II exemptions, transactions in currency by smaller businesses that meet specific criteria may be exempted.  PHASE I EXEMPTIONSPHASE II EXEMPTIONSA bank, to the extent of its domestic operationsA federal, state or local government agency or departmentAny entity exercising governmental authority within the U.S.Any entity (other than a bank) whose common stock or analogous equity interests are listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange or have been designated as a NASDAQ National Market Security on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange (with some exceptions)Any subsidiary (other than a bank) of any listed entity that is organized under U.S. law and at least 51% of whose common stock or analogous equity interest is owned by the listed entity.Non-Listed BusinessesHas maintained a transaction account at your bank for at least two monthsFrequently engages in transactions in currency with the bank in excess of $10,000 (5+ per year)Is incorporated or organized under the law of the U.S. or a state, or is registered and is eligible to do business within the U.S. or a stateOR, prior to the passing of two months’ time, the bank undertakes a risk-based analysis of the customer that allows you to form and document that the customer has a legitimate business purpose for conducting frequent large currency transactionsPayroll CustomersDefined solely with respect to withdrawals for payroll purposes from existing exemptible accounts and is a person who:  has maintained a transaction account at the bank for at least 2 months, operates a firm that frequently withdraws more than $10,000 in order to pay its U.S. employees in currency and is incorporated or organized under the laws of the U.S. or a state, or is registered as and eligible to do business within the U.S. or a state.OR, prior to the passing of two months’ time, the bank undertakes a risk-based analysis of the customer that allows you to form and document that the customer has a legitimate business purpose for conducting frequent large currency transactionsWe must file a one-time Designation of Exempt Person Report (DOEP) to exempt from currency transaction reporting:Each eligible listed companies or eligible subsidiaries.Phase II exemptions.The report must be filed electronically through the BSA E-Filing System within 30 days after the first transaction in currency that the bank wishes to exempt. We do not need to file a DOEP Report for Phase I customers that are banks, federal, state or local governments, or entities exercising governmental authority.  The information supporting each designation of a Phase I-exempt listed public company/subsidiary and Phase II exempt person must be reviewed and verified by the bank at least annually. We must document the annual review and verify at least annually that the Phase II exemptions are monitored for suspicious transactions.An ineligible business is defined as a business engaged primarily in one or more of the following activities:Serving as a financial institution or as agents for a financial institution of any type.Purchasing or selling motor vehicles of any kind, vessels, aircraft, farm equipment or mobile homes.Practicing law, accounting or medicine.Auctioning of goods.Chartering or operation of ships, buses or aircraft.Operating a pawn brokerage.Engaging in gaming of any kind.Engaging in investment advisory services or investment banking services.Operating a real estate brokerage.Operating in title insurance activities and real estate closings.Engaging in trade union activities.Engaging in any other activity that may, from time to time, be specified by FinCEN, such as a marijuana-related business.A business that engages in multiple business activities may qualify for an exemption as a non-listed business as long as no more than 50% of its gross revenues per year are derived from one or more of the ineligible business activities listed above.  Safe Harbor for Failure to File CTRsCTR rules provide a safe harbor that a bank is not liable for the failure to file a CTR for a transaction in currency by an exempt person, unless the bank knowingly provides false or incomplete information or has reason to believe that the customer does not qualify as an exempt customers.  In the absence of any specific knowledge or information indicating that a customer no longer meets the requirements of an exempt person, we are entitled to a safe harbor from civil penalties to the extent we continue to treat the customer has an exempt customer until the date of the customer’s annual review.CTR Exemption Record RetentionWe must retain copies of CTRs for 5 years from the date of filing.  Information Sharing under the USA PATRIOT ActOn September 26, 2002, final regulations implementing section 314 of the USA PATRIOT Act became effective.  The regulations established procedures for information sharing to deter money laundering and terrorist activity. On February 5, 2010, FinCEN amended the regulations to allow state, local and certain foreign law enforcement agencies access to the information sharing program.Section 314(a) Information SharingA federal, state, local or foreign law enforcement agency investigating terrorist activity or money laundering may request that FinCEN solicit, on its behalf, certain information from a financial institution or a group of financial institutions.  Upon receiving a completed written certification from a law enforcement agency, FinCEN may require us to search our records to determine whether we maintain or have maintained accounts for, or have engaged in transactions with, any specified individual, entity or organizationWhen we receive an information request, we must conduct a one-time search of our records to identify accounts or transactions of a named suspect.  Unless otherwise instructed by an information request, we must search our records for currency accounts, accounts maintained during the preceding 12 months and transactions conducted outside of an account by or on behalf of a named suspect during the preceding 6 months.  We must search or records and report any positive matches to FinCEN within 14 days, unless otherwise specified in the information request. [Who are the points of contact?  What is the search process?  How are searches documented?]The contents of these requests are confidential and are subject to similar controls established to comply with section 501 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act for the protection of customers’ non-public personal information.  Section 314(b) Information SharingSection 314(b) encourages financial institutions and associations of financial institutions located in the U.S. to share information in order to identify and report activities that may involve terrorist activity or money laundering.  Section 314(b) also provides specific protection from civil liability.  To avail our bank to the statutory safe harbor from liability, we must notify FinCEN of our intent to engage in information sharing and communicate that we have established and will maintain adequate procedures to protect the security and confidentiality of information shared.  A notice to share is effective for 1 year.  [Insert Financial Institution Here] does not participate in information sharing practices under Section 314(b).Purchase and Sale of Monetary InstrumentsBanks sell a variety of monetary instruments (e.g. bank checks or drafts, including foreign drafts, money orders, cashier’s checks and traveler’s checks) in exchange for currency.  Purchasing these instruments in amounts of less than $10,000 is a common method used by money launderers to evade large currency transaction reporting requirements.  Once converted from currency, criminals typically deposit these instruments in accounts with other banks to facilitate the movement of funds through the payment system.  In many cases, the persons involved do not have an account with the bank from which the instruments are purchased. [Indicate whether MIs are sold to non-customers]We must verify the identity of personal purchasing monetary instruments for currency in amounts between $3,000 and $10,000 inclusive and to maintain records of all such sales.  Records must be retained for 5 years.Contemporaneous purchases of the same or different types of instruments totaling $3,000 or more must be treated as one purchase. Multiple purchases during one business day totaling $3,000 or more must be aggregated and treated as one purchase if the bank has knowledge that the purchases have occurred.We may have a policy to require customers who are deposit accountholders and who want to purchase monetary instruments in amounts between $3,000 and $10,000 with currency to first deposit the currency into their deposit accounts.  Nothing within the BSA or its implementing regulations prohibits a bank from instituting such a policy.  However, FinCEN has taken the position that when a customer purchases a monetary instrument in amounts between $3,000 and $10,000 using currency that the customer first deposits into the customer’s account, the transaction is still subject to recordkeeping requirements.  [Describe whether the bank requires that a customer deposits funds into an existing account in order to purchase a monetary instrument]MONETARY INSTRUMENT RECORDKEEPINGACCOUNTHOLDERSNON-CUSTOMERSName of the purchaserDate of purchaseTypes of instruments purchasedSerial numbers of each of the instruments purchasedDollar amounts of each of the instruments purchased in currencySpecific identifying information, if applicableName and address of the purchaserSocial security or alien identification number of the purchaserDate of birth of the purchaserDate of purchaseTypes of instruments purchasedSerial numbers of each of the instruments purchasedDollar amounts of each of the instruments purchasedSpecific identifying information for verifying the purchaser’s identity (e.g. state of issuance and number on driver’s license)Note:  If the purchaser cannot provide the required information at the time of the transaction or through the bank’s own previously verified records, the transaction should be refused.Recordkeeping Requirements for Monetary Instrument SalesWe must verify the identity of personal purchasing monetary instruments for currency in amounts between $3,000 and $10,000 inclusive and to maintain records of all such sales.  Records must be retained for 5 years.Funds TransfersFunds transfer systems enable the instantaneous transfer of funds, including both domestic and cross-border transfers. Consequently, these systems can present and attractive method to disguise the source of funds derived from illegal activity.  The BSA was amended by the Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act of 1992 to authorize the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board to prescribe regulations for domestic and international funds transfers.  For each payment order in the amount of $3,000 or more that a bank accepts as an originator, we must obtain and retain:The name and address of the originator.Amount of the payment order.Date of the payment order.Any payment instructions.Identity of the beneficiary’s institution.As many of the following items are received with the payment order:Name and address of the beneficiary.Account number of the beneficiary.Any other specific identifier of the beneficiary.If the originator is not a bank customer, we must collect and retain the information listed above as well as additional information depending on whether the order is made in person.  MADE IN PERSONNOT MADE IN PERSONName and address of person placing the orderType of identification reviewedNumber of the identification documentThe person’s TIN or alien identification number, passport number, etc.  Name and address of the person placing the orderThe person’s TIN or alien identification number, passport number, etc.  We must retain records of funds transfers of $3,000 or more for 5 yearsTravel Rule:  For funds transfers of $3,000 or more, you must include the following information in the order at the time the order is sent to the receiving financial institution:Name of the transmitter and if the payment was ordered from an account, the account number of the transmitter.Address of the transmitter.Amount of the transmittal order.Date of the transmittal order.Identity of the recipient’s financial institution.As many of the following as are received with the order:  Name and address of the recipient.Account number of the recipient.Any other specific identifier of the recipient.Either the name and address or the numerical identifier of the transmitter’s financial institution.There are no recordkeeping requirements in the Travel Rule.If we are receiving a funds transfer, you must retain a record of the payment order for any payment order of $3,000 or more.  If the beneficiary is not an established customer of the bank, we must retain the following information for each payment order of $3,000 or more:PROCEEDS DELIVERED IN PERSONPROCEEDS NOT DELIVERED IN PERSONName and addressType of document reviewedNumber of the identification documentThe person’s TIN or alien identification number, passport number, etc.  If you have knowledge that the person receiving the proceeds is not the beneficiary, you must obtain and retain a record of the beneficiary’s name and address as well as the beneficiary’s identification.If the proceeds are not delivered in person, you must retain a copy of the check or other instrument used to effect the payment or you must record the information on the instrument.  Name and address of the person to whom it was sentFunds Transfer RecordkeepingFunds Transfers of $3,000 or MoreOr recordkeeping requirements with respect to funds transfer vary based upon our role in the funds transfer transaction.  Records to Retain as an Originator:Name and address of originatorAmount of the payment orderExecution date of the payment orderAny payment instruction received from the originator with the payment orderIdentity of the beneficiary’s bankAs many of the following items as are receive with the order:  name and address of the beneficiary, account number of the beneficiary, any other specific identifier of the beneficiaryFor each payment order that the bank accepts for an originator that is not an established customer of the bank, we must obtain additional information under 31 CFR 1020.410(a)(2)Records to Retain as an Intermediary or Beneficiary Bank:We must retain a record of the payment orderFor each payment order that the bank accepts for a beneficiary that is not an established customer of the bank, we must obtain additional information under 31 CFR 1020.410(a)(3)Foreign Correspondent Account Recordkeeping, Reporting & Due DiligenceForeign correspondent accounts can be a gateway into the U.S. financial system.  Banks are required to establish a due diligence program that includes appropriate, specific, risk-based and where necessary, enhanced policies, procedures and controls that are reasonably designed to enable us to detect and report, on an ongoing basis, any known or suspected money laundering activity conducted through or involving any correspondent account established, maintained, administered or managed by our bank. However, [Insert Financial Institution Here] does not maintain any foreign correspondent accounts.  Private BankingPrivate banking can be broadly defined as providing personalized financial services to wealthy clients. Section 312 of the USA PATRIOT Act added a subsection that requires each U.S. financial institution that establishes, maintains, administers or manages a private banking account in the U.S. for a non-U.S. person to take certain AML measures with respect to these accounts. For purposes of 31 CFR 1010.620, a “private banking account” is an account or any combination of accounts maintained at a bank that satisfies all three of the following criteria:Requires a minimum aggregate deposit of funds or other assets of not less than $1 million.Is established on behalf of or for the benefit of one or more non-U.S. persons who are direct or beneficial owners of the account.Is assigned to, or is administered by, in whole or in part, an officer, employee or agent of a bank acting as a liaison between a financial institution covered by the regulation and the direct or beneficial owner of the account.[Insert Financial Institution Here] does not maintain any private banking relationships as defined by regulatory guidance.Special Measures under the USA PATRIOT ActSection 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to require domestic financial agencies to take certain special measures against foreign jurisdictions, foreign financial institutions, classes of international transactions, or types of accounts of primary money laundering concern.  Section 311 provides the Secretary of the Treasury with a range of options that can be adapted to target specific money laundering and terrorist financing concerns. Orders and regulations implementing specific special measures taken under Section 311 are not static; they can be issued or rescinded over time as the Secretary of the Treasury determines that a subject jurisdiction, institution, class of transactions or type of account is no longer of primary money laundering concern.  Our BSA Department maintains several resources that are designed to alert us to any special measures issued. Additionally, we review FinCEN’s website on a monthly basis for current information on final special measures.  International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments ReportingEach person, including a bank, who physically transports, mails or ships currency or monetary instruments in excess of $10,000 at one time out of or into the U.S. (and each person who causes such transportation, mailing or shipment) must file a Report of International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments (CMIR).  A CMIR must be filed with the appropriate Bureau of Customs and Border Protection officer or with the commissioner of Customers at the time of entry or departure from the U.S.  When a person receives currency or monetary instruments in an amount exceeding $10,000 at one time that have been shipped from any place outside the U.S., a CMIR must be filed with the appropriate Bureau of Customs and Border Protection officer or with the commissioner of Customs within 15 days or receipt of the instruments, unless a report has already been filed.  The report is to be completed by or on behalf of the person request transfer of the currency or monetary instruments.  Regardless of whether an exemption from filing a CMIR applies, we are not relieved of other monitoring and reporting obligations under the BSA.  We must report the receipt or disbursement of currency in excess of $10,000 on a CTR. As of June 2016, [Insert Financial Institution Here] has not had any transactions conducted through the bank or for its customers that would require a CMIR filing. Report of Foreign Bank and Financial AssetsEach person, including a bank, subject to U.S. jurisdiction with a financial interest in, or signature or other authority over, a bank, a securities or other financial account in a foreign country must electronically file a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) if the aggregate value of these financial accounts exceeds $10,000 at any time during the calendar year.  An FBAR must be filed on or before June 30 of each calendar year for foreign financial accounts where the aggregate vale exceeded $10,000 at any time during the previous calendar year.As of June 2016, [Insert Financial Institution Here] did not maintain any such accounts that require FBAR filings.OFACThe Office of Foreign Assets Control, an office of the U.S. Treasury, administers and enforces economic trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted individuals and entities such as foreign countries, regimes, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers and those engages in certain activities, such as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or transnational organized crime.  All U.S. persons, including U.S. banks, bank holding companies and non-bank subsidiaries, must compliance with OFAC’s regulations. In general, the regulations that OFAC administers require us to:Block accounts and other property of specified countries, entities and individuals.Prohibit or reject unlicensed trade and financial transactions with specified countries.OFAC | Blocked TransactionsWe must block transactions that:Are by or on behalf of a blocked individual or entity; Are to go through a blocked entity; or,Are in connection with a transactions in which a blocked individual or entity has an interest.For example, if we would receive instructions to make a funds transfers payment that falls into one of these categories, we would execute the payment order and place the funds into a blocked account.  A payment order cannot be cancelled or amended after it is received by a U.S. bank in the absence of authorization by OFAC.OFAC | Prohibited TransactionsIn some cases, an underlying transaction may be prohibited, but there is no blockable interest in the transaction (i.e. the transaction should not be accepted, but there is no OFAC requirement to block the assets). In these cases, the transaction is simply rejected.  It is important to note that the OFAC regime specifying prohibitions against certain countries, entities and individuals is separate and distinct from the provision within the BSA’s CIP regulation that requires us to compare new accounts against government lists of known or suspected terrorists prior to account opening.  OFAC | LicensesOFAC has the authority, through a licensing process, to permit certain transactions that would otherwise be prohibited under its regulations.  OFAC can issue a license to engage in an otherwise prohibited transaction when it determines that the transaction does not undermine the U.S. policy objectives of particular sanctions programs or is other justified by U.S. national security or foreign policy objectives.  [Insert Financial Institution Here] does not maintain any licenses with OFAC.OFAC | ReportingWe must report all blockings to OFAC within 10 business days of the occurrence and annually by September 30th concerning assets blocked (as of June 30th).  We must keep an accurate and full record of each rejected transaction for at least 5 years after the date of the transaction.  As of June 2016, [Insert Financial Institution Here] has not identified any transactions that require blocking (or subsequent reporting) to OFAC.  OFAC | Compliance Program & Risk AssessmentWhile not required by specific regulation, but a matter of sound banking practice and in order to mitigate the risk of non-compliance with OFAC requirements, we must maintain an OFAC compliance program that identifies higher risk areas, provides for appropriate internal controls for screening and reporting, establishes independent testing for compliance, designates a bank employee or employees responsible for OFAC compliance and creates a training program for appropriate personnel in all relevant areas of the bank.  [Insert Financial Institution Here]’s OFAC Compliance Program is comprised of the following:Risk Assessment:  We have utilized the FFIEC Risk Assessment Matrix to determine our level of risk of doing business with any individual, entity or other party on the OFAC list.  Based on this risk assessment, attached as Exhibit B to this policy, we have determined our level of risk to be Low.Internal Controls:  We have implemented controls to ensure we do not do business with any individual, entity or other party on the OFAC list.  All potential customers must be compared to the OFAC list prior to account opening.  For incoming and outgoing wire transfers, the originator and beneficiary are screened against the OFAC list. The employee performing the OFAC check is required to mark the check box beside the originator and beneficiary and must initial the wire transfer form.  If a confirmed positive match is detected for an outgoing wire, the wire should not be sent and BSA Officer must be notified.  If a confirmed positive match is detected for an incoming wire, the funds must be frozen and the BSA Officer must be contacted.Tellers are required to screen all non-customers against the OFAC list who initiate cash advances or for check cashing services equal to or greater than $1,000, including the sale of monetary instruments.  Our customer base is screened against the OFAC list on a daily basis.  When the bank receives notification that the OFAC list has been updated, the updated list is imported into the bank’s system. When the report is complete, a full scan of the customer base is performed and possible matches are reviewed by the BSA Officer.  Independent Testing:  The scope of our BSA audit (both for the core bank and prepaid card function) incorporates an assessment of OFAC compliance.  Individual Responsible for OFAC Compliance:  The Board has designated individuals who are responsible for OFAC compliance, as outlined within the bank’s organizational chart.   These individuals are responsible for ongoing oversight and administration of our OFAC compliance program.Training:  OFAC compliance requirements are incorporated into bank-wide BSA training that is primarily accomplished through our annual all-employee in-service day.  BSA training is also incorporated into Board compliance training.Correspondent AccountsBanks maintain correspondent relationships at other domestic banks to provide certain services that can be performed more economically or efficiency because of the other bank’s size, expertise in a certain line of business or geographic location.  Such services may include:Deposit Accounts:  “Due from bank” accounts, which represent the bank’s primary operating account.Funds Transfers: A transfer of funds between banks may result from the collection of checks or other cash items, transfer and settlement of securities transactions, transfer of participating loan funds, purchase or sale of federal funds or processing of customer transactions.Other services:  Services include processing loan participations, facilitating secondary market loan sales, performing data processing and payroll services and exchanging foreign currency.Because domestic banks must follow the same regulatory guidelines, BSA/AML risk in domestic correspondent baking, including bankers’ banks are minimal in comparison to other types of financial services.  [Insert Financial Institution Here] does not maintain any foreign correspondent banking relationships.Bulk Shipments of CurrencyBulk shipments of currency entails the transportation of large volumes of U.S. or foreign bank notes. Bulk shipments of currency can be sent from sources either inside or outside the U.S. to a bank in the U.S. Shipments can also made from a bank in the U.S. to a recipient in a foreign jurisdiction. [Describe bank’s exposure to bulk shipments of currency]Electronic BankingE-banking systems, which provide electronic delivery of banking products to customers, include ATM transactions; online account opening; internet banking transactions; and, telephone banking.  [Insert Financial Institution Here] offers Internet banking (e.g. online banking, bill pay, electronic statements, mobile banking, telephone banking and debit cards).  Mobile banking was introduced to customers in 2011, which allowed customers to access mobile banking via a mobile application; view account balances and activity; make transfers, schedule bill payments or delete a scheduled payment; and, find the nearest branch or ATM.  In 2014, [Insert Financial Institution Here] introduced mobile deposit to allow customers to deposit checks from their smart phones using the mobile banking application.  Limitations (e.g. per check limits, daily limits and revolving 30-day limit) were implemented.  Each user must meet certain criteria to be approved to use the service, including length of time the deposit account has been opened, average deposit amounts, etc.  Due to the risk of check fraud and duplicate items through mobile deposit, deposited and rejected items are reviewed daily by the bank’s data processing department.We must ensure that our monitoring systems adequately capture transactions conducted electronically.  We must be alert to anomalies in account behavior, such as velocity of funds in the account, or in the case of ATMs, the number of debit cards associated with an account.  Remote Deposit CaptureRemote deposit capture (RDC) is a deposit transaction delivery system that has made check and monetary instrument processing (e.g. traveler’s checks or money orders) more efficient.  In broad terms, RDC allows our customers to scan a check or monetary instrument and then transmit the scanned image to our bank.  Scanning and transmission activities occur at remote locations.  RDC may expose us to various risks, including money laundering, fraud and information security.  Fraudulent, sequentially numbered or physically altered documents, particularly money orders and traveler’s checks, may be more difficult to detect when submitted by RDC and not inspected by a qualified person. We have implemented the following controls over our RDC products: [Describe RDC controls]ACH TransactionsTraditionally, the ACH system has been used for the direct deposit of payroll and government benefit payments and for the direct payment of mortgages and loans.  However, usage has expanded to include one-time debits and check conversation.  Examples include credit payroll direct deposits, social security, dividends, interest payments, mortgage and other loan payments, insurance premiums and a variety of other consumer payments initiated through merchants or businesses. [Describe bank’s ACH exposure. Does the bank originate and receive?]International ACH PaymentsThe IAT is a Standard Entry Class code for ACH payments that enables us to identify and monitor international ACH payments and perform screening to ensure compliance with OFAC requirements. [Describe bank’s IAT exposure and processes]Third Party Service ProvidersA third party service provider (TPSP) is an entity other than an originator, ODFI or RDFI that performs any functions on behalf of an originator, ODFI or RDFI with respect to the processing of ACH entries.  The ACH system was designed to transfer a high volume of low-dollar domestic transactions, which pose lower BSA/AML risks. However, the ability to send out high-dollar and international transactions may expose us to higher BSA/Aml risks.  ACH transactions that are originated through a TPSP may also increase BSA/AML risks, making it difficult for an IDFO to underwrite and review originator transactions for compliance with BSA/AML rules.  Risks are heightened when neither the TPSP nor the ODFI performs due diligence on the companies for whom they are originating payments. [Describe the bank’s TSPS exposure and controls]Prepaid Access[Insert Financial Institution Here] has established a growing prepaid access line of business that has increased the bank’s risk profile with regard to the size and complexity of the programs as well as regulatory scrutiny over administration of this line of business.  Inherently, this line of business presents elevated levels of risk.  Law enforcement investigations have found that some prepaid cardholders have used false identification and funded their initial loads with stolen credit cards, or have purchased multiple prepaid cards under aliases.  In the placement phase of money laundering, criminals may load cash from illicit sources onto prepaid access products and send them to accomplices inside or outside the United States.  Investigations have disclosed that both open- and closed-loop prepaid cards have been used in conjunction with, or as a replacement to, bulk cash smuggling.  Transactions may pose the following unique risks to the bank:Funds may be transferred to or from an unknown third party.Verification of cardholder identity may be done entirely remotely, relying on third party program managers, processors or distributors.As with other modes of electronic payments, holders may be able to use prepaid access products internationally, thus avoiding border restrictions and reporting requirements applicable to cash and monetary instruments.Transactions may be credited or debited to the user’s payment product immediately, although there may be a lag in delivery of funds to the issuing bank, creating a load timing risk for the bank.Specific holder activity may be difficult to determine by reviewing activity through a pooled account.Data in underlying pooled accounts may be held or managed by third parties, separate from the issuing bank.Marketing of payment products, customer service and onboarding of new customers may be handled primarily by third parties separate from the issuing bank.  The customer may perceive the transactions as less transparent.Source of payroll funding may come through an intermediary bank and may not be transparent.To help mitigate BSA, fraud and other risks, as well as to address regulatory concern, [Insert Financial Institution Here] has implemented several controls within its prepaid access function.  The bank created a Prepaid Card Program Committee, which has primary and ongoing oversight of the prepaid access function.  Over the last twelve (12) months, the committee has developed a multi-layered oversight process.  Detailed Fact Sheets were developed for each program. The data within these fact sheets was then used to create risk assessments for each program. Fact sheets and risk assessments provide consistency in program documentation and assessment.  In 2016, these documents were expanded to include a cover sheet that provides a “snapshot” of each program.  The Committee has applied this process to new and existing programs.  These documents and the resulting risk then flows through to the bank’s Global Prepaid Card Risk Assessment and Policy, which lay out the framework for program administration.  The bank relies on third-party program managers to employ identity verification processes to reasonably identify card applicants for programs that require KYC procedures.  Management has established testing procedures to ensure these processes are being followed by program managers.  Any CIP failures identified by the bank during testing are relayed back to the program manager for further information and possible blocking of cardholder funds until appropriate customer information is obtained.  Each program has predetermined load and balance caps as well as other thresholds. Activity is monitored on an ongoing basis and any activity outside the established thresholds is brought to the attention of program managers. Depending on the severity of the issue (i.e. dollar amount involved and/or frequency of attempts) the card may be closed and/or a suspicious activity report filed.Representatives from the Prepaid Card Program Committee routinely communicate with program managers.  The Committee meets on an ongoing basis via teleconference, with meeting typically held every other week. Meetings are conducted according to an established agenda and minutes of meeting discussions are formally documented.  Ongoing education has been identified as critical to ongoing effective administration of the bank’s prepaid card function.  Each member of the committee has been assigned, and must successfully complete, training specifically designed for those involved in the prepaid industry.  Additionally, the BSA and Assistant BSA Officers successfully completed coursework and testing under the Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist program sponsored by the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists (ACAMS).    Independent testing primarily focused on the bank’s prepaid access function has also been identified as a critical control. In 2015, [Insert Financial Institution Here] engaged a third party (Crowe) to perform a comprehensive audit of the bank’s prepaid card function.  This audit resulted in the identification of several control and administrative weaknesses within the program.  Management has incorporated these findings into the bank’s BSA Program Action Plan. Progress in addressing prepaid, as well as all BSA-related findings, is routinely monitored, discussed and documented.  Third Party Payment ProcessorsNon-bank or third party payment processors are bank customers that provide payment-processing services to merchants and other business entities. These processors are not generally subject to BSA/AML requirements. As a result, some processors may be vulnerable to money laundering, identity theft, fraud schemes or other illicit transactions, including those prohibited by OFAC. [Describe bank’s exposure TPPPs]Brokered DepositsThe use of brokered deposits is a common funding source for many banks. Deposit brokers provide intermediary services for banks and investors. This activity is considered higher risk because each deposit broker operates under its own guidelines for obtaining deposits.  Money laundering and terrorist financing risks arise because we may not know the ultimate beneficial owners or the sources of funds.  The deposit broker could represent a range of clients that may be of higher risk for money laundering and terrorist financing.[Insert Financial Institution Here] acquires brokered deposits through US Sterling and Depository Trust Company (DTC).  US Sterling matches potential financial institution investors with an institution looking for brokered deposits. US Sterling is a federally regulated entity. CDs are opened in the names of client financial institutions. As such, the underlying financial institutions are exempt from CIP. However, [Insert Financial Institution Here] screens the institutions against the OFAC list when wire deposits are received.DTC brokered CDs are opened with a tax ID number of DTC and all CDs are titled as CEDE and Co, in care of DTC.  US Sterling is registered with FINRA and maintains a BSA/AML compliance program that includes OFAC policies and procedures, all of which are on file at [Insert Financial Institution Here].  The procedures state that US Sterling is responsible for CIP, OFAC, FinCEN and Treasury recording and reporting.  DTC is a member of the Federal Reserve.  Brokered deposits from US Sterling and DTC are considered low risk due to their clients being financial institutions, which are federal regulated and therefore exempt from CIP requirements.  Privately Owned ATMsPrivately owned ATMs are particularly susceptible to money laundering and fraud.  Privately owned ATMs are typically found in convenience stores, bars, restaurants, grocery stores or check cashing establishments.  Most dispense currency, but some dispense only a paper receipt (scrip) that the customer exchanges for goods or services.  Fees and surcharges for withdrawals, coupled with additional business generated by customer access to an ATM, make the operation of a privately owned ATM profitable.  Money laundering can occur through privately owned ATMs when an ATM is replenished with illicit currency that is subsequently withdrawn by legitimate customers.  [What is the bank’s exposure to privately owned ATMs?  What are the controls?]The BSA software platform account opening workflow incorporates questions related to a potential customer’s operation of privately owned ATMs.Non-Deposit Investment Products and InsuranceWe offer non-deposit investment products and insurance through a joint marketing arrangement IPI Financial.  Under this relationship, [Insert Financial Institution Here] maintains a dual employee arrangement with IPI Financial whereby the bank’s NDIP and insurance professional is dually employed by the bank and IPI Financial.  Because of this dual-employee arrangement, we retain responsibility over NDIP activities.  [What is this arrangement?  Per BSA guidance, even if contractual agreements establish the financial services corporation as being responsible for BSA/AML the bank needs to ensure proper oversight of its employees, including dual employees and their compliance with all regulatory requirements.]Concentration AccountsConcentration accounts are internal accounts established to facilitate the processing and settlement of multiple or individual customer transactions within the bank, usually on the same day.  Money laundering risk can arise in concentration accounts if the customer-identifying information, such as name, transaction amount and account number, is separated from the financial transaction.  If separation occurs, the audit trail is lost and accounts may be misused or administered improperly. [Describe the usage and internal controls over concentration accounts]Custodial CDs[Insert Financial Institution Here]  maintains a custodial CD program.  Due to the nature of these products, associated risk, as defined by regulatory guidance, is considered to be high.  [Describe the controls over the custodial CD program.  What is the monitoring process?]Check Cashing for Non-Customers[Insert Financial Institution Here] will cash on-us checks for non-customers. Tellers, frontline personnel and customer service representatives must record all [Insert Financial Institution Here] checks cashed for non-customers when checks total $1,000 or more per item.  The following information must be logged for each such transaction:The payee’s name.Date of transaction.Amount of the check presented.Records must be maintained for 5 years.  Employees are responsible for monitoring transactions for suspicious activity, such as unsigned checks, blank payees and structured transactions.  Lending ActivitiesLending activities include, but are not limited to, real estate, trade finance, cash-secured, credit card, consumer, commercial and agricultural.  Lending activities can include multiple parties (e.g. guarantors, signatories, principals and loan participants).  The involvement of multiple parties may increase the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing when the source of funds are not transparent.  This lack of transparency can create opportunities in any of the three stages of money laundering or terrorist financing schemes.  All loans are considered to be accounts for purposes of the CIP regulations.  As such, we have implemented procedures to ensure all parties to loan transactions we originate are subject identity verification and OFAC screening prior to disbursement of loan proceeds.  Additionally, we have implemented procedures by which lending transactions are monitored for suspicious activity on an ongoing basis. [Describe procedures]Trade Finance ActivitiesTrade finance typically involves short-term financing to facilitate the import and export of goods. These operations can involve payment if documentary requirements are met (i.e. letter of credit) or may instead involve payment if the original obligor defaults on the commercial terms of the transaction (e.g. guarantees or standby letters of credit).  In both cases, a bank’s involvement in trade finance minimizes payment risk to importers and exporters.  However, the international trade system is subject to a wide range of risks and vulnerabilities that provide criminal organizations with the opportunity to launder the proceeds of crime and move funds to terrorist organizations with a relatively low risk of detection.As of June 2016, [Insert Financial Institution Here] does not maintain any trade finance arrangements.Trust and Asset Management ServicesTrust accounts are generally defined as a legal arrangement in which one party transfers ownership of assets to a person or bank to be held or used for the benefit of others.  Trust and asset management accounts, including agency relationships, present BSA/AML concerns similar to those of deposit taking, lending and other traditional banking activities. Concerns are primarily due to the unique relationship structures involved when the bank handles trust and agency activities.As of June 2016, [Insert Financial Institution Here] does not offer trust or asset management services. High Balance CustomersWe run an internal report every 6 months to identify all customers or related and aggregated accounts with a minimum of $1 million on deposit. The report is reviewed for unusual fluctuations, ACH activity, cash transactions or transactions outside of the customer’s typical activity pattern.Non-Resident Aliens and Foreign IndividualsForeign individuals maintaining relationships with U.S. banks can be divided into two categories:  aliens and non-resident aliens (NRAs).  For definitional purposes, an NRA is a non-U.S. citizen who:  is not a lawful permanent resident of the U.S. during the calendar year and who does not meet the substantial presence test OR has not been issued an alien registration receipt card (i.e. Green Card).  Although NRAs are not permanent residents, they may have a legitimate need to establish an account relationship with a U.S. bank.  NRAs use bank products and services for asset preservation, business expansion and investments.   It may be difficult to verify and authenticate an NRA accountholder’s identification, source of funds, and source of wealth, which may result in BSA/AML risks.  We have implemented procedures to identify NRAs at the time of account opening and to ascertain the level of risk each NRA may present to our bank, based on factors such as:Accountholder’s home country.Types of products and services used.Forms of identification.Source of wealth and funds.Unusual account activity.Risk levels are initially determined through completing the account opening workflow within our BSA software platform and are supported by ongoing behavior-based monitoring within the system.When an NRA requests to open a deposit account, the account opening employee must notify the BSA Officer to ensure proper procedures are followed.  Politically Exposed PersonsWe must take reasonable steps to ensure that we do not knowingly or unwittingly assist in hiding or moving the proceeds of corruption by senior political figures (domestic and foreign), their families or their associates.  Because the risks presented by PEPs vary by customer, product and service, country and industry, identifying, monitoring and designing controls for these accounts and transactions must be risk-based.To determine whether an accountholder is a domestic or foreign senior political figure, we utilize the account opening workflow in our BSA software platform to ask relevant questions that would surface such association. [Insert Financial Institution Here] maintains no account relationships with domestic or foreign senior political figures.Non-Bank Financial Institutions and MSBsNBFIs are broadly defined as institutions other than banks that offer financial services.  Common examples of NBFIs include, but are not limited to:Casinos and card clubs.Securities and commodities firms.Money service businesses.Insurance companies.Loan or finance companies.Operators of credit card systems.Other financial institutions (e.g. dealers in precious metals, stones or jewels; pawnbrokers).NBFIs are extremely diverse, ranging from large multi-national corporations to small, independent businesses that offer financial services only as an ancillary component to their primary business (e.g. grocery store that offers check cashing).  The range of products and services offered, and the customer bases served by NBFIs, are equally diverse.  As a result of diversity, some NBFIs may be lower risk and some may be higher risk for money laundering.To determine whether any existing or potential customer operates as an NBFI or MSB, we have built relevant questions into the our BSA software platform account opening workflow.When an MSB is identified, we must follow specific procedures to ensure the MSB is appropriately registered with FinCEN as an MSB.  We must also undertake the following actions to mitigate BSA/AML risk associated with MSB activities:Confirm the MSB is subject to examination for AML compliance by the IRS or state, as applicable.Affirm the existence of a written BSA/AML program and verify the BSA Officer’s name and contact information.Ensure the MSB’s established banking relations and/or account activity is consistent with expectations.Ensure the MSB is an established business with an operating history.Determine whether the MSB provides services only to local residents.Determine whether the MSB is a principal with one or a few agents, or its acting like an agent for one principal.Determine whether the MSB’s customers conduct routine transactions in low dollar amounts.Determine whether the MSB’s business operations are consistent with information obtained at the time of account opening.Determine whether money transmitting activities are limited to domestic entities or limited to lower dollar amounts.As of June 2016, [Insert Financial Institution Here] does not maintain any account relationships with NBFIs or MSBs within the “core” bank.  However, [Insert Financial Institution Here]  has exposure to MSBs through or prepaid access/card program.  To monitor these relationships and conduct ongoing monitoring, we have implemented an MSB risk assessment that is designed to determine the level of risk posed to the bank from these ongoing relationships.Professional Service ProvidersA professional service provider (PSP) acts as an intermediary between its client and the bank. PSPs include lawyers, accountants, investment brokers and other third parties that act as financial liaisons for their clients.  These providers may conduct financial dealings for their clients.  For example, an attorney may perform services for a client, or arrange for services to be performed on the client’s behalf, such as settlement of real estate transactions, asset transfers, management of client monies, investment services and trust arrangements. A typical example is interest on lawyers’ trust accounts (i.e. IOLTA).  These accounts contain funds for a lawyer’s various clients and act as a standard bank account with one unique feature:  The interest earned on the account is ceded to the state bank association or another entity for public interest and pro bono purposes.In contrast to escrow accounts that are set up to serve individual clients, PSP accounts allow for ongoing business transactions with multiple clients. Generally, we have no direct relationship with or knowledge of the beneficial owners of these accounts, who may be a constantly changing group of individuals and legal entities.Within our account opening workflow in our BSA software platform, we ask specific questions designed to determine whether a customer could be classified as a PSP.  In rating the risk associated with any customer, including PSPs, our workflow takes into account risk factors, in addition to the nature of our customer’s business, to determine the level of BSA/AML risk exposure to our bank.Non-Governmental Organizations and CharitiesWithin our account opening workflow in our BSA software platform, we ask specific questions designed to determine whether a customer could be classified as an NGO or charity.  In rating the risk associated with any customer, including NGOs and charities, our workflow takes into account risk factors, in addition to the nature of our customer’s business, to determine the level of BSA/AML risk exposure to our bankBusiness Entities | Domestic and ForeignWithin our account opening workflow in our BSA software platform, we ask specific questions designed to determine whether a customer could be classified as a domestic or foreign business entity.  In rating the risk associated with any customer, including domestic and foreign business entities, our workflow takes into account risk factors, in addition to the nature of our customer’s business, to determine the level of BSA/AML risk exposure to our bankAs of June 2016, [Insert Financial Institution Here] does not maintain account relationships with any foreign business entities.  Domestic business entities are subject to ongoing monitoring conducted through our BSA software platform. Accounts presenting moderate or high risk are subject to additional monitoring and review.Cash Intensive BusinessesWithin our account opening workflow in our BSA software platform, we ask specific questions designed to determine whether a customer could be classified as a cash intensive business.  In rating the risk associated with any customer, including cash intensive businesses, our workflow takes into account risk factors, in addition to the nature of our customer’s business, to determine the level of BSA/AML risk exposure to our bankCash intensive businesses are subject to ongoing monitoring conducted through our BSA software platform. Accounts presenting moderate or high risk are subject to additional monitoring and review.Banking Marijuana-Related BusinessesThe Controlled Substances Act (CSA) makes it illegal under federal law to manufacture, distribute or dispense marijuana.  Many states impose and enforce similar prohibition. Notwithstanding the federal ban, 29 states and the District of Columbus have legalized the use of medical marijuana, while 6 states have also legalized the use of recreational marijuana.  Because of the disconnect between federal and state laws concerning marijuana manufacture, distribution, dispensary and use, former United States Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole issued a memorandum (Cole Memo) to all U.S. Attorneys providing guidance to federal prosecutors concerning marijuana enforcement under the CSA.  The Cole Memo guidance applied to all Department of Justice enforcement activity, including civil enforcement and criminal investigations and prosecutions, concerning marijuana in all states.  However, in January 2018, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced his decision to rescind this policy, allowing federal prosecutors to bring forth criminal cases against marijuana manufacturers and distributors.  The decision to reverse policy, given the growth of the cannabis industry caused confusion among financial institutions about how to do business with marijuana manufacturers, distributors and dispensary without running afoul of federal money laundering laws.  While this policy outlines the provisions of the rescinded Cole Memo and discusses the bank’s required actions to be taken in banking marijuana manufacturers, distributors and dispensaries, it is the policy of [Insert Financial Institution Here] not to do business with identified marijuana-related businesses (MRBs) until resolution is achieved at the federal level.  [You will want to adjust this paragraph, should you do business or plan to do business with MRBs at the state level].Please refer to the Banking Marijuana Policy maintained under separate cover.Ponzi & Other SchemesThese types of schemes can offer consistent “profits” only as long as the number of investors continues to increase. The schemes are self-sustaining as long as cash outflows can be matched by monetary inflows. Ponzi schemes are based on fraudulent investment management services. Investors contribute money to the “portfolio manager” who promises them a high return and then when those investors want their money back, they are paid out with the incoming funds contributed by later investors. The individual organizing this fraud is in charge of controlling the entire operation. They merely transfer funds from one client to another and forgo any real investment activities. We have trained our staff to look for and report the following red flags that could indicate possible Ponzi schemes:Customers who provide insufficient or suspicious information Customers who are reluctant to comply with reporting and recordkeeping requirements Funds transfers to or from a financial secrecy haven Unusual transfers of funds between related entities Sudden inconsistencies in currency transaction patterns Suspicious intracompany transfers and other banking activity by a company combined with establishment of a bank or a branch office in the company’s offices where, due to electronic connections between the bank and company’s systems, bank representatives could monitor all banking activity of the company Criminal history of a company’s principals combined with the company’s lack of legitimate business activities, irregular documentation, bank employee visits to discuss company’s business and majority of bank branch employees simultaneously working at the company Banking procedures that violated internal rules combined with personal or business ties between the bank and company such as overlapping Boards of Directors or bank employees who were relatives of the company’s principal Discovery by a bank of prior criminal history of a company principal, litigation accusing the company of wrongdoing or regulatory enforcement activity concerning the company Continued provision of banking services by bank or company even after bank conducted diligence on company’s operations and decided to liquidate bank’s own position in company’s investment funds Diversion of funds to accounts not listed in deposit instructions Diversion of funds to personal commodities trading accounts Attendance by bank representatives at investor meetings where misrepresentations of the bank’s role were made Institution of unusual systems by a bank necessary to ensure against repeated “bouncing” of checks by company. Activity will monitored through the normal transaction monitoring procedures and will be investigated by the BSA Officer in accordance with our SAR decision-making processes.  Elder Financial ExploitationWe can play a key role in addressing elder financial exploitation due to the nature of the client relationship.  Older Americans hold a high concentration of wealth as compared to the general population. In the instances where elderly individuals experience declining cognitive or physical abilities, they may find themselves more reliant on specific individuals for their physical well-being, financial management, and social interaction. While anyone can be a victim of a financial crime such as identity theft, embezzlement, and fraudulent schemes, certain elderly individuals may be particularly vulnerableWe have trained our staff to monitor for and report to the BSA Officer the following red flags that may indicate the existence of elder financial exploitation. Erratic or unusual banking transactions, or changes in banking patterns: Frequent large withdrawals, including daily maximum currency withdrawals from an ATM;Sudden Non-Sufficient Fund activity;Uncharacteristic nonpayment for services, which may indicate a loss of funds or access to funds;Debit transactions that are inconsistent for the elder;Uncharacteristic attempts to wire large sums of money;Closing of CDs or accounts without regard to penalties.Interactions with customers or caregivers: A caregiver or other individual shows excessive interest in the elder's finances or assets, does not allow the elder to speak for himself, or is reluctant to leave the elder's side during conversations;The elder shows an unusual degree of fear or submissiveness toward a caregiver, or expresses a fear of eviction or nursing home placement if money is not given to a caretaker;The financial institution is unable to speak directly with the elder, despite repeated attempts to contact him or her;A new caretaker, relative, or friend suddenly begins conducting financial transactions on behalf of the elder without proper documentation;The customer moves away from existing relationships and toward new associations with other "friends" or strangers;The elderly individual's financial management changes suddenly, such as through a change of power of attorney to a different family member or a new individual;The elderly customer lacks knowledge about his or her financial status, or shows a sudden reluctance to discuss financial matters.Consistent with the standard for reporting suspicious activity as provided for in 31 CFR Part 103 (future 31 CFR Chapter X), if we know, suspect, or have reason to suspect that a transaction has no business or apparent lawful purpose or is not the sort in which the particular customer would normally be expected to engage, and we know of no reasonable explanation for the transaction after examining the available facts, including the background and possible purpose of the transaction, we should file a Suspicious Activity Report, selecting the appropriate characterization of suspicious activity in the Suspicious Activity Information section of the SAR form and include the term "elder financial exploitation" in the narrative portion of all relevant SARs filed. It is important to note that the potential victim of elder financial exploitation should not be reported as the subject of the SAR. Rather, all available information on the victim should be included in the narrative portion of the SAR.Elder abuse, including financial exploitation, is generally reported and investigated at the local level, with Adult Protective Services, District Attorney's offices, sheriff's offices, and police departments taking key roles. We emphasize that filers should continue to report all forms of elder abuse according to institutional policies and the requirements of state and local laws and regulations, where applicable. BSA Recordkeeping RequirementsThe BSA establishes recordkeeping requirements related to various types of records including:  customer accounts (e.g. loan, deposits, etc.), BSA filing requirements, and records that document a bank’s compliance with the BSA.  In general, the BSA requires that we maintain most records for at least 5 years. These records can be maintained in many forms, including original, microfilm, electronic, copy or a reproduction.  Whatever the method, we must ensure that the records are accessible in a reasonable period of time.  The records related to the transactions discussed below must be retained for 5 years. However, as noted, the records related to the identity of a bank customer must be maintained for 5 years after the account is closed. Additionally, on a case-by-case basis, we may be ordered or requested to maintain some of these records for longer periods (e.g. by U.S. Treasury Department Order or law enforcement investigation).BSA RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTSExtensions of Credit in Excess of $10,000 (Not Secured by Real Property)Our records must contain:  Name of borrower, address of borrower, amount of credit extended, nature/purpose of the loan, and the date of the loan.International Transactions in Excess of $10,000A record of any request made or instructions received or given regarding a transfer of currency or other monetary instruments, checks, funds, investment securities or credit greater than $10,000 to or from any person, account or place outside the U.S.Signature CardsA record of each grant of signature authority over each deposit account.Account StatementsA statement, ledger card, or other records on each deposit account showing each transaction in, or with respect to, that account.Checks in Excess of $100Each check, draft or money order drawn on the bank or issued and payable by it that is in excess of $100Deposits in Excess of $100Each deposit slip or credit ticket reflecting a transaction in excess of $100 or the equivalent records for direct deposit or other funds transfer deposit transactions.  The slip or the ticket must record the amount of any currency involved.  Records to Reconstruct Demand Deposit AccountsRecords prepared or received by the ban in the ordinary course of business, which would be needed to reconstruct a transaction account and to trace a check in excess of $100 deposited in a demand deposit account through its domestic processing system or to supply a description of a deposited check in excess of $100.Certificates of Deposit Purchased or PresentedThe record must contain:  Name of customer (purchaser or presenter); address of customer; TIN; description of the CD; notation of the method of payment if purchased; and, the date of the transaction.Purchase or Monetary Instruments of $3,000 or MoreWe must maintain a record of each bank check or draft, cashier’s check, money order or traveler’s check for $3,000 or more in currency. If the purchaser has a deposit account with the bank, the record must contain:  Name of purchaser; date of purchase; type(s) of instruments purchased; amount in dollars of each of the instrument(s) purchased; and, serial number(s) of the instrument(s) purchased.If the purchaser does not have a deposit account with the bank, the record must contain:  Name of purchaser; address of purchaser; social security number of purchaser or alien identification number; date of birth of the purchaser; date of purchase; type(s) of instrument purchased; amount in dollars of each of the instrument(s) purchased; serial number(s) of the instrument(s) purchased; and, description of document or method used to verify the name and address of the purchaser (e.g. driver’s license state of issuance and number)Funds Transfers of $3,000 or MoreOr recordkeeping requirements with respect to funds transfer vary based upon our role in the funds transfer transaction.  Records to Retain as an Originator:Name and address of originatorAmount of the payment orderExecution date of the payment orderAny payment instruction received from the originator with the payment orderIdentity of the beneficiary’s bankAs many of the following items as are receive with the order:  name and address of the beneficiary, account number of the beneficiary, any other specific identifier of the beneficiaryFor each payment order that the bank accepts for an originator that is not an established customer of the bank, we must obtain additional information under 31 CFR 1020.410(a)(2)Records to Retain as an Intermediary or Beneficiary Bank:We must retain a record of the payment orderFor each payment order that the bank accepts for a beneficiary that is not an established customer of the bank, we must obtain additional information under 31 CFR 1020.410(a)(3)Suspicious Activity Report and Supporting DocumentationWe must maintain a record of any SAR filed and the original or business record equivalent of any supporting documentation for a period of 5 years from the date of filing.Currency Transaction ReportWe must maintain a record of all CTRs for a period of 5 years from the date of filing.Designation of Exempt PersonWe must maintain a record of all designation of persons exempt from CTR reporting as filed with the Treasury for a period of 5 years from the designation date.Customer Identification ProgramWe must maintain a record of all information we obtain under our procedures for implementing our Customer Identification Program.  At a minimum, these records must include:  All identifying information about a customer (e.g. name, date of birth, TIN and address)A description of the document that we relied upon to verify the identity of the customerA description of the non-documentary methods and results of any measures we took to verify the identity of the customerA description of our resolution of any substantive discrepancy discovered when verifying the identifying information obtained.We must retain the identifying information about a customer for a period of 5 years after the account is closed, or in the case of credit card accounts, 5 years after the account becomes closed or dormant.We must retain the information relied on, methods used to verify identity and resolution of discrepancies for a period of 5 years after the record is made.Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability and Divestment ActWe must retain a copy of any report filed with FinCEN and any supporting documenting, including the foreign bank certification or other responses to an inquiry, for a period of 5 years.Penalties for Non-CompliancePenalties for money laundering and terrorist financing can be severe.  A person convicted of money laundering can face up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $500,000.  Any property involved in a transaction or traceable to the proceeds of a criminal activity, including property such as loan collateral, personal property or bank accounts, may be subject to forfeiture.  Banks and individuals may incur criminal and civil liability for violating AML and terrorist financing laws.  For example, the Department of Justice may bring criminal actions for money laundering that may include criminal fines, imprisonment and forfeiture actions.  Additionally, we could risk losing our bank charter and bank employees could risk bring removed and barred from banking.  There are also criminal penalties for willful violations of the BSA and its implementing regulations and for structuring transactions to evade BSA reporting requirements.  For example, a person, including a bank employee, willfully violating the BSA or its implementing regulations is subject to a criminal fine of up to $250,000 or 5 years in prison, or both.  A person who commits such a violation while also violating another U.S. law, or engaging in a pattern of criminal activity, is subject to  a fine of up to $500,000 or 10 years in prison, or both.  A bank that violates certain BSA provisions or special measures, faces criminal penalties up to the greater of $1 million or twice the value of the transaction.The federal banking agencies and FinCEN can bring civil money penalty actions for violations of the BSA.  In addition to criminal and civil money penalty actions taken against them, individual may be removed from banking for a violation of AML laws.  All of these actions are publicly available.Employee AttestationI, _____________________________, certify that I have received and read [Insert Financial Institution Here]’s BSA Policy.
