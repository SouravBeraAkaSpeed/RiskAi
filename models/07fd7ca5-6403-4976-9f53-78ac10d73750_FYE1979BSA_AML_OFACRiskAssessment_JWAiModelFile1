  Context : {{. Document Name - [object Object]    - BSA/AML & OFAC Annual Risk AssessmentsAssessment Period: July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016OverviewJ. Wallace Bank was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in the Township of Washington, New Jersey. Its parent company, J. Wallace Financial Corp. operates as a savings and loan holding company for J. Wallace Bank (“J. Wallace”) that provides retail and commercial banking services to individual and business customers in the United States. As of June 30, 2016, it operates 99 full service branches in Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Passaic counties, New Jersey. J. Wallace qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” and has elected to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. This allows J. Wallace Financial Corp. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company. J. Wallace offers a range of deposit products, including non-interest and interest-bearing demand and NOW checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts, and time deposits. J. Wallace provides multifamily loans that consists of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings; commercial real estate loans comprising mortgage loans secured by commercial offices, retail space, warehouses, and mixed-use buildings; residential real estate mortgage loans, such as one to four family residential real property and consumer loans; and construction loans, which include one to four family and commercial development project loans. Its loan products also include second mortgage and equity loans; home equity lines of credit; and other loans, including business loans secured by cash and other business assets, account loans, and commercial line of credit loans. In addition, the company invests in securities and real estate properties. Developing a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) risk profile is the foundation in establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program (Policy and Procedures). It also assists Management of J. Wallace in aligning appropriate resources to the BSA function.Management of J. Wallace recently performed its annual BSA/AML Risk Assessment and OFAC Risk Assessment respectively in accordance with the guidance provided within the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual released December 2014. The risk assessments are based on identification and measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. This report reflects the bank’s level of risk exposure to being used by criminals to further their illegal activity and terrorist financing, as well as, possible OFAC violations as of June 30, 2016. It also serves as a basis for the development of risk- based policies, procedures, training, testing where appropriate and for allocation of resources to the BSA function.The BSA/AML Risk Assessment takes into consideration 12 different risk factors and the OFAC Risk Assessment takes into consideration 7 different risk factors, which comprise the “Inherent Quantity of Risk” ratings. Each factor is important for purposes of establishing an appropriate and effective BSA/AML/OFAC Program, but each factor does not, by itself, reflect the complete picture of the risk of J. WALLACE being used for illegal activity or terrorist financing. Consequently, a high rating on an individual factor does not mean the bank is high risk; it only means that particular area of the bank is high risk and that appropriate controls should be in place to mitigate the risk.The quantity of BSA/AML and OFAC risks assigned herein do not take into consideration factors contributing to the bank’s risk of non-compliance with applicable BSA/AML/OFAC regulations, regulatory examination violations, or past or recent enforcement actions. Moreover, the Quantity of Risk does not evaluate the effectiveness of controls. The effectiveness of controls is evaluated during the annual BSA Independent Testing Audit.Inherent Quantity of Risk ratings do not take into account any mitigating controls. The matrices herein detail controls, processes, training, testing and experience that allow Management to further assess J. Wallace Residual Risks. This assists in determining whether the BSA/AML/OFAC Program is appropriate for the risk profile of the bank and whether adequate resources necessary to effectively administer the Program are in place. The Residual Risks provide the bank’s Management and the Board of Directors with a more accurate representation of the bank’s overall BSA/AML/OFAC risk exposure after addressing the mitigating controls in place.Executive SummaryThe risk of non-compliance with BSA/AML or OFAC arising from violations of, or non-conformance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws, rules, regulations, regulatory requirements, or internal policies and procedures is a risk to earnings, capital, reputation, franchise value, or growth opportunities. This risk exposes J. Wallace to potential enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts.It is important to note that the BSA/AML and OFAC risk assessments did not evaluate the bank’s risk of non-compliance with the minimum regulatory requirements of a BSA/AML/OFAC Program; rather, it identified the money laundering, terrorist financing, and OFAC risks associated with the bank’s customers, products, services, and geographies.As a result of the BSA/AML Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered HIGH for the Bank Secrecy Act and potential money laundering activities mainly due to the following:Number of cash-intensive business customers;Number of SARs filed for cash structuring;Branches in high risk jurisdictions as defined by HIDTA and HIFCA;Number of customers who are Nonresident Aliens (NRAs); High risk products: Mobile deposit and remote deposit capture;Number and volume of international wires to and from international locations.Due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered MODERATE.As a result of the OFAC Risk Assessment, J. Wallace Bank’s Inherent Quantity of Risk is considered MODERATE for OFAC risk exposure mainly due to the following:Volume of higher risk NRA customers;Wire transfers from international locations;International ACH transactionsHowever, due to the mitigating controls J. Wallace has put in place, the Residual Risk is considered LOW.These ratings suggest that the bank’s customers, entities, products, services, geographies and activities currently have an elevated risk of being utilized for money laundering and terrorist financing and an average risk of encountering OFAC issues.The Board of Directors and Management of J. Wallace understand their BSA and OFAC responsibilities and are committed to implement and maintain an effective on-going BSA and OFAC compliance program commensurate with the Bank’s risk profile. Such a program includes effective administration of the Customer Identification Program, Customer Due Diligence Procedures and Enhanced Due Diligence Procedures to address appropriately the risks identified, as well as robust programs for training Bank staff and for the independent testing of the BSA/AML/OFAC programs.To ensure that the Bank’s controls remain at least adequate to maintain the residual risks of its activities within tolerable levels, the BSA/AML/OFAC program includes the following priorities:Maintain rigorous programs to increase compliance awareness bank wide.Provide advanced BSA AML business line training on an ongoing basis.Maintain programs to embed responsibility for BSA AML compliance in each of the Bank’s lines of business.Maintain robust KYC/CDD/EDD processes.Maintain rigorous CIP and SAR procedures.Maintain robust transaction monitoring for higher risk customers / products.Continue to evaluate the adequacy of reporting to management and the Board of Directors.Continue to evaluate the effectiveness of the Bank’s BSA AML transaction monitoring system, Patriot Officer and soon to be migrated to FIS PRIME.During the last fiscal year, Mercadien, P.C., Certified Public Accountants (“Mercadien”) completed a BSA AML System Optimization for the Bank. The independent review included procedures to verify the quality of alerts being generated for the purposes of monitoring at the Bank.Mercadien concluded that the Bank’s transaction monitoring system parameters appear adequate, as established, to detect potentially suspicious activity for review. Mercadien recommended deletions and additions to the scenarios being run by Patriot in an effort to reduce redundant rules and enhance the Bank’s coverage. These recommendations were implemented in the 4th quarter of FYE 15’, which led to more efficiency in the Bank’s transaction monitoring for suspicious activity.GRC Risk Solutions, LLC (“GRC”) completed a validation of the AML transaction monitoring system, Patriot Officer. The independent validation included the following:Review of BSA/AML System Design Review BSA/AML Workflow Processing Review of List Monitoring Alerts Performance of a detailed, system-driven Transaction Code Mapping exercise for transaction codes identified during the three-month period Performance of Alert Detection scenario coverage verification. The validation concluded the following:Bank customers, non-customers, accounts, and transactions are scrubbed through the appropriate sanction screening lists. All transaction codes are properly mapped between the core system (i.e., FIS Bankway) and the BSA/AML system (i.e., Patriot Officer). All wire transactions, foreign and domestic, are properly mapped between FIS Bankway and Patriot Officer. The Patriot Officer system has adequate transaction coverage across the Bank’s products and services. However, some minor recommendations are noted below. MethodologyThe BSA/AML/OFAC risk assessment follows guidance in the most current edition of the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual (the “FFIEC Manual”) last updated in December 2014. This report sets forth the results of the risk assessments as of June 30, 2016. It estimates J. Wallace Bank’s vulnerability to illegal activity (including terrorist financing), as well as to possible OFAC violations taking into account the identification and measurement of the BSA/AML/OFAC risks associated with its products, services, customers, and the geographic locations of its operations and its customers. This report concludes with a discussion of the need, if any, for enhancements to the Bank’s policies, procedures or programs for training and testing possibly warranted taking into account both the Bank’s current operations and its near-term growth plans, including the planned introduction of new products and services, as well as whether the Bank appropriately allocates resources to the BSA/AML/OFAC compliance functions. Non-compliance with BSA/AML/OFAC laws, regulations, rules or regulatory requirements – and non-compliance with internal policies and procedures adopted to achieve compliance with them – is likely to have a significant adverse effect on earnings, capital, reputation, franchise value and growth opportunities. Such non-compliance exposes J. Wallace to enforcement actions, civil money penalties, payments of damages and the voiding of contracts.The Bank prepared a baseline risk assessment profile relating its preparedness and exposure to respond to a broad set of BSA/AML conditions – specifically concerning its own business risk.  The Bank considered information about its current products, services, geographic areas for service, customers, and international presence in determining its risk exposure to money-laundering and terrorist financing activity.  Based upon this assessment the Bank developed appropriate customer due diligence, suspicious activity monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping controls appropriate to manage its risk exposure.Within the Risk Assessment profile there are numerous risk exposure characteristics that were considered in which the Bank weighed the probability of money laundering or terrorist financing activity occurring.  Additionally, independent of probability, the Bank estimated the scope of impact and relevant scale of the impact to the business that would result if the event actually occurred or a deficiency was made known in our BSA/AML program. Furthermore, the assessment considered the Bank’s resources and readiness to comply with BSA/AML requirements, our policy, procedures, and controls by weighing:Experience – Level of knowledge and experience by staff in managing BSA compliance programs, analytical experience in detecting money laundering and terrorist financing schemes, and administration management in reporting and recordkeeping.Training – Depth, frequency, and comprehensiveness of training to general staff, personnel with BSA responsibilities, and BSA Department personnel. Testing – Validation of the BSA/AML program through independent testing. Program – Comprehensiveness of Policy, procedures, and controls necessary to manage the risk exposure in those areas of greatest risk and attaining compliance with the regulations and laws.In reviewing the Probability of an event due to the nature of customer, product, and service against its potential Impact and the need for the Bank to maintain a strong Readiness response capability; the Bank derived overall Risk Exposure prioritization ratings that reflect the Bank’s priority to take action in establishing programs to effectively manage the risk to an acceptable level. CaveatsThese risk assessments include subjective assessments of the magnitude of inherent risk and of the effectiveness of mitigating controls. Neither the risk assessments themselves nor the procedures for developing them, however, provide a validation of these assessments. The Bank’s internal audit service provider performs such a validation through its independent testing of the Bank’s exposure to BSA/AML/OFAC risks and the effectiveness of its controls in mitigating those risks. These subjective assessments, however, do take into account the service provider’s results, as well as the results of supervisory examinations, including identified violations of law and enforcement actions.Not all activities are clearly illegal/improper or clearly legitimate/proper, until appropriate authorities designate such activity as legal or illegal.Forward Looking RiskThere have been no significant changes in J. Wallace existing products, services, and business strategy during the assessment period. The bank is de-emphasizing retail and continues to seek aggressive growth primarily in commercial businesses, with a particular emphasis on financing multi-family apartments.The following is a high level summary of modeled strategic scenarios that the Bank may consider in the future.Scenario 1: Organic Growth ScenarioOrganic Growth ScenarioContinued loan platform in CRE, but maintain concentration below Board limitsPayment of regular quarterly cash dividends and special dividends each DecemberScenario 2: Scenario 1 plusFed Forecast Rate EnvironmentCRE loan originations decline by 10% (since prepayment speed slow and loans extend)Scenario 3: Scenario 1 plusScenario 1 with a reduction in all loan originations of 15% and deposit growth of 10%BSA/AML Direction of RiskThe J. Wallace BSA/AML Risk Assessment performed as of June 30, 2016 yielded a HIGH Inherent Risk Rating and a MODERATE Residual Risk Rating, which is consistent with the risk rating of the previous assessment. The direction of Risk over the next 12 months is expected to be trending slightly higher as a result of the following:Moderate turnover at the management level;Moderate turnover in Corporate staff positions;High and critical turnover in Branch staff positions (Tellers);Moderate increase in incoming international wire activity;Moderate increase in high risk customers;Aggressive growth in lending, retail and commercial banking;Moderate to high increase in eBanking and RDC product lines.Bank SizeJ. Wallace falls under Uniform Bank Performance Report (UBPR) 101S SUPPLEMENTAL PEER GROUP, defined as all Stock-owned insured savings banks in excess of $1 billion. As of June 30, 2016, total asset size of J. Wallace was $3,669,338,000. From the last assessment period with an asset size of $3,353,065,000, the bank has grown about 1% and management continues to seek aggressive growth.Branch LocationsThe number of J. Wallace branches increased by one to 99 with the addition of the Westwood branch. All J. Wallace branches are located in both HIDTA / HIFCA zone. HIFCA stands for High Intensity Financial Crime Area. HIDTA stands for High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas. HIFCA areas were created through legislation as a means of concentrating law enforcement efforts at the federal, state, and local levels in high intensity money laundering zones. The number of branches located in HIDTA/HIFCA zones has not changed since last assessment period. J. Wallace provides deposit, retail banking and commercial banking.The Bank’s 99 branch offices are located in 4 Northern NJ Counties: Bergen, Hudson, Passaic and Essex Counties. The bank has considered the areas serviced by its offices and areas of its customers’ residences and business locations. Comprehensive training for all departments was completed during the year with these factors in mind. The uses of the Patriot Officer Automated Anti-Money Laundering System and employee training have increased awareness and detection of suspicious activity but the Bank’s inherent risk remains High due to the area designations.Overseas Branches/Parallel BankingJ. Wallace does not have overseas branches, nor does it maintain any Parallel Banking relationships. Management does not seek to open any overseas branches at this time or enter into any parallel banking relationships.Mergers & AcquisitionsThere have not been any mergers or acquisitions during the assessment period and management does not foresee any such activity in the near future.Potential or Pending Legal ProceedingsAs of June 30, 2016 there is no material pending or material potential legal proceeding involving J. Wallace Financial Corp., J. Wallace Bank, or its subsidiaries. Customer BaseThe Bank considered the nature of its customers and the type of account opening activity, longevity of accounts, and transitory nature of its customers.  The Bank has been established as a community Bank since 1911 and supports a growing customer base within its market area. In addition, the commercial lending department has expanded our market area to surrounding states. The Bank has a total of 6 Nonresident Alien account owners with 6 total accounts. These accounts are opened only when prescribed written criteria are met but some degree of growth would have no effect on our risk. Despite this growth and expansion our risk exposure remains as Moderate.As of 6/30/2016, J. Wallace Bank’s deposit customer base consisted of 18,960 Consumer and 4,267 Business & Non-Personal accounts. The total balance for consumer accounts was $1,625,482,189.00 and $634,517,108.00 for business accounts.Although, there is a moderate decrease in customer growth from last assessment period, BSA staff remains sufficiently staffed to identify, research and report suspicious activities taking into consideration the bank’s overall risk profile and the volume of transactions.Number of Transactional Accounts 201631841     201532489     648-1.99%Account Type FYE 2016FYE 2015Difference % Increase/Decrease  Savings $165,623,337$160,020,589.13$5,602,7483.38% *CDs and IRAs $959,534,062$761,566,721.75$197,967,34020.63% Personal DDA $167,412,615$179,096,031.12-$11,683,416-6.98% Personal MMDA $332,912,175$288,950,192.20$43,961,98313.21% Business DDA $285,719,693$243,808,181.95$41,911,51114.67% Business MMDA $348,797,415$108,148,095.22$240,649,32068.99% $2,259,999,297$1,741,589,811.37$518,409,48622.94%Account Type20162015Difference %Increase/Decrease Personal18,96018,8511090.57%Business & Non-Personal4,2673,9163518.23%    23,227                     22,7674601.98%Increases in personal transactional accounts were not overly significant at 0.57%. Business and other non-personal accounts increased by 8.23% and continued efforts in FYE 2017 will be made to increase this market segment.CIP/CDD/EDDAt account opening, customer identification is required and verified through documentary and non- documentary methods and a customer profile is created. CIP is performed on any person or business (including business account signers) opening an account. Each person must present primary and secondary forms of identification consistent with the requirements outlined the CIP Procedures. At a minimum, the following information must be obtained: name, date of birth, tax identification number, physical address, occupation, line of business and telephone number. For “persons” other than individuals (such as; corporations, partnerships, or trusts), J. Wallace requires documentation showing the legal existence of the entity. Customer due diligence is performed for all types of customers, and enhance due diligence is performed for higher risk customers at account opening and throughout the term of the relationship. Accounts are usually denied if negative records are found through verifications. All customers are subject to periodic reviews based on their risk levels.Per Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, the Bank reviewed its Customer Identification Program (“CIP”) considering the law’s requirements. The CIP defines the procedures and activities within the Bank for complying with the BSA/AML regulations and all new account openings apply CIP requirements. These include:Risk based account opening verification procedures and controls to verify the identity of any person or business entity seeking to open an account.Record maintenance procedures to record the information used to verify the person or business identity.Collecting sufficient information to develop a transaction profile on all new customers. The primary objective of this procedure is to enable the Bank to predict with relative certainty the transaction activity in which the customer is likely to be engaged.Reporting responsibilities and procedures for account opening activities that identify suspicious activity which may warrant investigation and/or the required filing of a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) to authorities.Periodic review and reporting by the Bank’s BSA Department on customers to determine whether the person or entity appears on any government agency lists of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations.Initial and recurring training on both the regulations and the Banks Customer Identification Program; such training to occur at least annually.Management and Board of Director reporting requirements.Revisions are made as needed to the CIP, with a minimum of an annual review.Compliance verification review of the Banks Customer Identification Program in accordance with the Interagency CIP examination procedures to be completed by an independent party.Periodic monitoring of compliance with CIP policies and procedures by the BSA/AML Officer.The Bank does not currently make use of the Reliance Provision for account opening, but may consider in the future. If the Bank does make use of the Reliance Provision, prior to doing so will evaluate its’ procedures and controls and effect necessary changes to this policy.High Risk Customers J. Wallace has a moderate number of high risk customers and a moderate number of cash-intensive retail business and service provider customers, such as Accountants, Doctors, Dentists, MSB’s, food stores, restaurants and super markets.The number of cash intensive businesses has decreased with Charitable Organizations, Accountants & CPA’s, other service providers, retail stores and restaurants seeing a moderate increase. Doctors, Dentists, Lawyers, MSB’s and Jewelry Stores have relatively remained static since last assessment period. The Bank considered the account classifications of high-risk customers and businesses as defined in the Bank's Customer Risk Classifications Procedures. Also considered were research of account activity, front line personnel experience and the current regulatory environment. Use of the Automated Anti-Money Laundering System, Patriot Officer and employee training has increased awareness and detection of suspicious activity. During previous risk assessment periods the increased focus on obtaining retail business customers doubled customers considered high risk which necessitated increased and ongoing monitoring of these customers transactions. During the current assessment period there was a decrease in the number of high risk customers, from 220 to 157, a decrease of 63 customers or 29%.Due to the reclassification of accounts during the 3rd quarter, there were 157 customers reclassified as High Risk and scheduled for EDD which was completed. This decrease was due to the review of 63 accounts; mostly professional service providers who while inherently high risk had at least 3 consecutive reviews with no unusual or suspicious activity. These 63 customers were however placed in monitoring status in the transaction monitoring system Patriot Officer to immediately notify the department of any suspicious activity. The current high risk customer list stands at 157.The following procedure is in place for a potential Watch List match:Watch List Report – If Matches Found – Change Record Status to “Undetermined” and assign the report to the BSA Department for review - Click Save. This will generate an email Alert to multiple persons for review. Do not proceed with the transaction until the report is approved by the BSA Department. Assign the Report to “BSA Department” and click “Save”. After approval you will receive an email advising the report has been assigned back to you. Access the report in your “Alert Inbox”; change the Alert State to “Close” and click “Save”. Print the Watch List Report. If a positive match is determined do not proceed with the transaction and follow OFAC Reporting Procedures.We currently have 157 customers classified as High Risk based on their business type. A breakdown of these customer classifications is as follows: High Risk by Type of BusinessNumber of CustomersDoctors & Dentists1Lawyers29Other Service Providers *15Money Service Business Agents (MSBs) *(Money Order Sales Agents who are also Convenience Stores, Pharmacies, or other retail.)32*32 of these businesses are also classified as Cash Intensive Businesses (CIB).Charitable Organizations1Jewelry Stores2Other Retail Stores and Restaurants *53Total133High Risk for Suspicious Activity24High Risk Watchlist CustomersHigh Risk for Suspicious Activity24High Risk by Type of Business133 157In addition, all High Risk customers are classified as such, on the Watch List for Suspicious Activity and monitored on a quarterly basis. Included in the 157 are 133 customers that are also classified as High Risk due to their business classification.Despite being located in a High Intensity Drug and Crime Risk Area and the additional re-classification of existing customers as High Risk it is believed the Risk Assessment remains as Moderate for the following reasons: the additional High Risk customers’ accounts were being monitored through Patriot Officer for suspicious activity before being re-classified; there has been no terrorist activity detected by the Bank or notified of by any law enforcement agency; there has been no appreciable increase in suspicious activity detected during the past 2 assessment periods; and, it is believed the use of the automated anti-money laundering detection system and the BSA employee training provided justifies the Risk Rating remaining as Moderate.Trade Finance, Import/Export CompaniesThe bank does not maintain any Trade Finance relationships. Politically Exposed Persons (“PEPs”)The bank does not accept or maintain accounts for PEPs. Money Service Businesses (“MSBs”)As a matter of policy, J. Wallace does not open or accept MSB accounts, only agents for MSBs such as Western Union.Third Party Payment ProcessorsThe day-to-day responsibility of oversight of Third Party Provider Management has been assigned to the Senior Vice President/Corporate Secretary who will interact with the primary relationship managers and periodically report to the Management Compliance Committee. An annual review will be provided to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors by the Management Compliance Committee.All Providers will be risk rated based on the nature of the Bank’s relationship or proposed relationship with the Provider. A rating of high, medium or low risk will be assigned to each Provider. The Provider will then be further classified based on likelihood of exposure to our customers’ non public personal information (“NPPI”). These ratings will be utilized to determine the level of due diligence that is required. Provider ratings will be reviewed annually to identify any relationships that might have changed during the course of the year.Products & Services J. Wallace continues to offer the following existing products and services:Consumer deposit products: Checking, Money Market, Statement and Passbook Savings, Certificate of Deposits, Traditional IRAs (CDs).Consumer lending product: Residential MortgagesCommercial deposit products: Business Checking, Money Market, Statement Savings, and Certificate of Deposits.Commercial lending products: Commercial Mortgage Loans, Commercial Lines of Credit, Term Loans, and Trade Financing.Sale of Monetary instruments (Cashier’s Checks, Money Orders, Travelers Checks and Gift Checks) to customers only.J. Wallace provides Electronic Banking services to its customers such as ATM cards, Debit Card, ACH, Remote Deposit Capture (RDC), Wire Transfers, and Internet. J. Wallace does not offer the following high risk products and services:Stored value cardsElectronic CashMonetary InstrumentsThe Bank does not sell monetary instruments or perform funds transfer for non-customers. Only J. Wallace customer (“on-us”) checks are cashed for non-customers up to a maximum of $500.00. Photo Identification is required and Watch List checks are performed for each. By limiting the issuance of these items to customers only mitigates the risk by enabling the Bank to monitor these items through the Bank’s automated anti-money laundering system. The Bank performs OFAC / Watch List Checks for all third party payees (non-customers) listed on Cashier’s Checks and J. Wallace Bank customer checks cashed in the branches.Business customer with payroll accounts requires an agreement on file with a list of current employees. Employees who do not have accounts with J. Wallace are required to present photo identification and Watch List checks are performed the 15th of every month and each time a new list is received. When cashing checks employees’ names are verified against the current list. The branches log on-us checks cashed but they have been logging them for both customers and non-customers. That practice has ceased and they will now only be logging on-us checks cashed for non-customers. The Vice President, Retail Banking believes the branches currently cash only a small amount of on-us checks for non-customers, excluding customer payroll checks. When these checks are cashed, including business customer payroll checks, valid current identification, such as a driver’s license or any other item listed in our new account procedures, is obtained and the information is recorded and retained and an OFAC Watch List Report is run and retained. The transaction is then approved by a supervisor.There were a total of 12 Bank Checks sold during the assessment period and 868 money order sales. The instruments were sold as follows: Bank Checks (12) totaling $144,295.93Money Orders (649) totaling $237,943.72Two branches (#7 and #30) did not have any monetary instrument sales for the risk assessment period.	The sale of monetary instruments is relatively low compared to the overall customer base. Branch Administration should consider amending the policy and procedures relating to Monetary Instruments. They should become more comprehensive by including regulatory guidance for processing Monetary Instruments and related definitions.Debit CardsDebit Card (Point of Sale (“POS”) Purchases) Transactions per monthDebit Card Transaction Volumes  Month/YearDDA PurchaseMC PurchaseMC Cash AdvanceMC Int'l PurchaseDDA Purchase/Cash BackTotal Debit Card Transaction VolumeJul-1516,97932,540103281,97051,827Aug-1516,85632,646103421,90951,763Sep-1516,33230,69063301,81749,175Oct-1517,45131,740103271,99551,523Nov-1517,56030,85763571,85150,631Dec-1520,08333,79064061,78556,070Jan-1615,93028,57423501,83946,695Feb-1615,93332,13063251,69750,091Mar-1618,23134,98723181,93455,472Apr-1617,69634,75283151,95754,728May-1619,15436,63143041,97758,070Jun-1618,21835,66583181,89356,102Jul-1618,68735,01703152,04056,059Total FYE Point of Sale (“POS”) Purchases FYE 2016FYE 2015IncreasePercent IncreasePOS688,206593,610151,61015.93%Fraud TotalsFraud TotalsClaimsItemsTotal Fraud AmtTotal RecoveryJan 15 to June 1595484$25,420.53$2,208.50July 15 to June 16123458$30,951.53$10,939.17 218942$56,372.06$13,147.67Total Amount of FY Fraud Claims FYE 2016FYE 2015IncreasePercent IncreaseFraud Claims Total$30,951.53$25,420.53$5,501.0021.75%Funds TransferWire TransfersThe Bank considered the nature of fund transfer activity including customers, locations, frequency, and currency amounts. No transfers are performed for non-customers and foreign wire transfers for customers are performed on an incoming basis only. All wire transfers are also entered manually through FSI’s Patriot Officer Wire Transfer Module. This enables staff to ensure all Foreign Wire Transfers received through US correspondent financial institutions are entered as Foreign Wires in the system.

Wallace uses FSI Item Processing as its software vendor and third-party processor to provide remote deposit capture.Remote deposit capture refers to computer hardware, software and telecommunications systems that enable commercial customers to process deposits to their depositary accounts with J. Wallace Bank from electronic devices of varying descriptions located at their place of business or elsewhere by scanning and transmitting images of deposited items. Once scanned and transmitted, the physical checks are no longer needed except to keep as back up until the transaction is properly posted.Proper identification of all businesses and those authorizing business applications must be verified. High risk industries are to be identified and generally avoided; however, if exceptions are to be granted, these require additional scrutiny and additional levels of approval. BSA Guidelines are to be followed and "Know Your Customer" considerations in this context require the use of different identification, authentication, and transaction verification methods than those used with traditional delivery channels. It is the policy that documents requiring signatures, such as final contracts for services, require the client to meet with a bank representative and/or be verified as outlined in the bank's new business account procedures. New RDC accounts like all J. Wallace accounts must be completed in person with a bank representative present. Many of our RDC customers are also borrowers, often with locations distant from our branches.RDC policies, procedures, and activity monitoring process are in place and site visits are performed annually.

Therefore an increase in ACH activity will not have an adverse effect on its risk rating.Brokered DepositsThe Board of Directors of J. Wallace Bank promotes the maintenance of effective controls to ensure the liquidity needs of the institution will be met. The Board considers the prudent use of brokered funds to be a permissible liquidity source. Brokered deposits are defined as all deposits directly or indirectly obtained through deposit brokers.As per FFIEC guidance, J. Wallace generally does not accept deposit brokers:Who are not known to Oritani;Conduct business or obtain deposits outside of the United States;Are unable to provide reference(s) from reputable banks;Provide other services that appear suspicious or may create the appearance of impropriety;Refuse to cooperate and provide material information during the due diligence process;Use technology or engage in behavior that would provide anonymity to customers. The Board has appointed the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), under the general direction of the Board, to implement and administer the brokered deposit funding program. The Board of Directors will annually review and approve brokered deposit funding program policy. The CFO will recommend changes to it as appropriate for review and approval of the Board.Risk ManagementThe Chief Risk Officer must evaluate and approve the use of brokered deposits. Risks associated with the use of brokered deposits include liquidity, interest rate, transaction, reputation and compliance risk.Liquidity RiskLiquidity risk refers to the risk to earnings or capital that arises from the bank’s inability to meet its obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses. Management mitigates this risk by limiting the bank’s exposure to the use of brokered deposits. The risk is also limited by the substantial capital position the bank currently enjoys. Interest Rate RiskInterest rate (market) risk is the risk to a bank’s condition resulting from adverse movements in market rates or prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates or equity prices. This type of risk focuses on the economic scenarios relative to the value of the Bank in the current interest rate environment and the sensitivity of that value to changes in interest rates. A thorough analysis will be conducted prior to commitment to a brokered deposit contract including rate, fees, and duration of said contract. Limits to the use of brokered deposits will be determined in this policy. The use of these funds will be reviewed by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.Transaction RiskTransaction risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from problems with service or product delivery and may include potential financial losses from human error or fraud, incomplete information and related decision-making or operation disruption. The risk is a function of the adequacy of internal control and information systems, employee integrity, management policies and operation processes. In order to mitigate transaction risk, due diligence will be conducted on all deposit brokers prior to entering into a relationship with them and on an annual basis thereafter. Management information systems will provide ease in monitoring and tracking the use of brokered deposits. The system will include a listing of funds obtained through each significant program, rates paid on each instrument, maturity information and concentrations. The concentration of brokered deposits will be prepared at least quarterly by the CFO and reviewed by the Board in the financial report. Further, the use of brokered deposits and the management of its function will be reviewed annually by the bank’s external auditors.Reputation RiskReputation risk is the potential that negative publicity regarding the Bank’s business practices, whether true or not, will impact our ability to raise brokered deposits. For this reason, bank management responsible for overseeing the brokered deposit program must be aware of any information that could affect the market’s or public’s perception of the soundness of the institution.Compliance RiskCompliance risk arises from violations of or nonconformance with those laws, regulations or prescribed practices that govern the Bank’s activities. There are two specific compliance concerns regarding brokered deposits- Capital Level Requirements and Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering compliance. FDIC requires an institution to be well capitalized in order to accept brokered deposits. The Bank only does business with deposit brokers who are registered with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). Brokers registered with the SEC are required to follow the same general CIP requirements as banking institutions and are periodically examined by the SEC for compliance.As of 06/30/2016, the bank has opened 4 Brokered deposit accounts totaling $12,269,656.11 and it is planned to increase these deposits during FYE 2017. While these deposits are considered High Risk, this risk is mitigated by the fact that we are only accepting time deposits and a limited amount of money market accounts. There will be no demand deposit accounts accepted. Brokered money market accounts will be subject to Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD).J.
