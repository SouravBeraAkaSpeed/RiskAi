  Context : {{, a review will be performed using the Standard Account Review Sheet.  The review method for medium risk accounts would be the same but based upon a two-year anniversary of the assigned risk rating date.  The Standard Account Review Sheet is subject to the necessary review and approval based on established requirements.Refer to Appendix G for Standard Account Review SheetSpecial MeasuresThe USA PATRIOT Act gives the Secretary of the Treasury authority to impose special measures against foreign jurisdictions, foreign financial institutions, transactions involving such jurisdictions or institutions, or one or more types of accounts, that are determined to pose a “primary money laundering concern” to the United States.The BSA/AML Compliance Officer will coordinate compliance with such special measures on a bank-wide basis.  It is the policy of the Bank to promptly comply with any special measures prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.  Whenever the Secretary imposes special measures, Compliance shall communicate the special measures to the affected businesses, which will take the steps necessary to terminate affected account relationships, communicate to customers, and/or amend existing policies, procedures, and controls or develop new ones to comply with the prescribed special measures.Information SharingThe USA PATRIOT Act provides for information sharing between the Government and Financial Institutions, as well as between financial institutions themselves, in an effort to deter money laundering and terrorist activities.Section 314(a) of the Act establishes a mechanism for law enforcement agencies to communicate the names of suspected terrorists and money launderers to covered financial institutions for the purpose of promptly identifying accounts and transactions involving those suspects.  Under 314(a), information requests are batched and forwarded to covered financial institutions from FinCEN every two weeks (although single requests may be sent in urgent situations).  Note:  The designated points of contact for receiving 314(a) are reflected on the Bank’s Call Report Filings.Upon receipt of a 314(a) request, Company covered financial institutions are required to search the following records:Deposit account recordsFunds transfer recordsRecords for the sale of monetary instrumentsLoan recordsThe Bank will search its records for the preceding 12 months for accounts, and for the preceding 6 months for transactions, and report them to FinCEN.  As the Bank has several third party, and marketplace lenders, in addition to the scan of accounts, and transactions, the Bank will conduct a FinCEN scan for any retained loans as well as any loans funded within the last 12 months.  If other matching records are found in this process, they will also be reported to FinCEN, even if they fall outside of the requested time frame or pertain to an account or transaction in an area of the financial institution that was not required to be searched but were searched anyway, or pertain to a record that was not required to be maintained under federal law or regulation but existed nonetheless.Searches are required to be completed and a response to be sent to FinCEN with any matches within two weeks of receiving the 314(a) request.If there is a positive match for an account or a transaction, the following information will be gathered:The identity of the individual, entity, or organizationThe account number(s); opening date, type of transactionsAll identifying information provided by the account holder in connection with the opening of the account, such as social security number, taxpayer identification number, passport information, date of birth, and address.Names are highly confidential and should be shared only on a limited basis.  Under no circumstances should 314(a) names be shared with any other financial institution.  Records regarding 314(a) searches must be retained in a secure area.If the 314(a) search results in a positive match, it is incumbent upon the Bank to conduct an investigation of the account relationship and/or transaction activity and should there be reasonable belief that suspicious activity occurred, an Incident Report must be drafted for SAR consideration.  If the Bank decides to close the account, it will first notify the law enforcement contact on the request to determine if closing the account would interfere with an active investigation.  If law enforcement requests that an account remain open, the bank will request written confirmation.Note:  The bank does not participate in 314(b)Refer to Appendix H for procedures concerning responses to information requests Subpoenas Received from Law EnforcementThe receipt of a grand jury subpoena will cause the bank to conduct a risk assessment and account relationship review of the subject customer.  The information resulting from the review, transactions, and accounts subject to the subpoena will be evaluated and a determination will be made as to whether additional account monitoring should be implemented, or a suspicious activity report filed.Currency Transaction Reporting and ExemptionsIn compliance with the BSA regulations, the following types of reports are submitted to the U.S. government:FinCEN Form 112, Currency Transaction Report (CTR):  A CTR must be filed for each deposit, withdrawal, exchange of currency, or other payment or transfer, by, through or to a financial institution, which involves a transaction in currency of more than $10,000.  Multiple currency transactions must be treated as a single transaction if the financial institution has knowledge that:  (a) they are conducted by or on behalf of the same person; and, (b) they result in cash received or disbursed by the financial institution of more than $10,000.  A CTR must be filed within 15 days electronically from the date of the transaction with FinCEN.  The bank must retain copies of CTRs for five years from the date of the report.FinCEN Form 105, Report of International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments (CMIR):  Each person who physically transports, mails or ships, or causes to be physically transported, mailed, shipped or received, currency, traveler’s checks, and certain other monetary instruments in an aggregate amount exceeding $10,000 into or out of the United States must file a CMIR.The preparation process of these reports will be through the Bank’s automated monitoring system. The automated monitoring system loads Cleartouch data into the system, and when reportable transactions are found, auto-generates populated CTRs. The branch manager is responsible for performing a secondary review to ensure accuracy and submitting the report.    Currency transactions over $3,000 are recorded daily on the “Currency Transactions Greater Than $3,000 Log”.  Daily, this log is reviewed by the branch manager/designee to ensure that multiple currency transactions totaling over $10,000 for a customer are properly reported.  This log also must be reviewed for possible structuring situations and initialed as evidence of review.  On a monthly basis, the branch manager/designee will review this report on a cumulative basis to detect patterns or structuring trends.  The branch manager/designee will evidence this review by signing this monthly report. Structuring is the breaking up of transactions for the purpose of evading the BSA reporting and recordkeeping requirements and, if appropriate thresholds are met, should be reported as a suspicious transaction.  Structuring may be indicative of underlying illegal activity; further, structuring itself is unlawful under the BSA.Penalties and asset forfeiture for money laundering can be severe under BSA:Individuals, including employees of financial institutions, convicted of money laundering face up to 20 years in prison for each money-laundering transaction.Businesses, including banks and individuals, face fines up to $1,000,000 or twice the value of the transaction, whichever is greater.Financial Institutions can lose their charter/license, and employees risk being removed and barred from the business.Any property involved in the transaction or traceable to the proceeds of the criminal activity, including loan collateral, personal property and, under certain conditions, entire bank accounts (even if some of the money in the account is legitimate) may be subject to forfeiture.Safe Harbor Provision The Annunzio Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act (1992) – U.S.C. 5318(g)(3) - provides a safe harbor for the bank and its employee from civil liability for reporting known or suspected criminal offenses or suspicious activity by filing a SAR. A bank employee should feel safe in reporting suspicious activity.  The government works closely with the bank to ensure that all employees are protected from any liability.  Federal Law prohibits Employees from disclosing the fact that a SAR has been filed.  Never discuss any Suspicious Activity Reporting requirements with a customer. Voluntarily giving additional information to customers, such as when you completed an incident report for their suspicious activity makes the employee liable for prosecution for violating Anti-Money Laundering Laws.Recordkeeping and Record Retention RequirementsThe following rules apply to CIP-related records:Identifying information (name, address, date of birth, and government-issued ID number) must be retained for five years after the date the account is closedAll other information and documentation required by CIP rules, such as other recorded customer information, copies of documents used to verify identity, records of the steps taken and the results of verification performed by non-documentary means, and the resolution of discrepancies that may have arisen between information provided by a customer and the documentary and non-documentary evidence used to verify such information, must be retained for five years after the record is made.KYC-related records can be maintained in either hard copy or in electronic form, so long as the records are accurate and readily accessible within five calendar days.The Bank must maintain a record of each funds transfer of $3,000 or more, which it originates, acts as an intermediary for, or receives for five years.  The amount and type of information that must be recorded and kept depends upon the Bank’s role in the funds transfer process.  Also, the Bank must pass certain information along to the next bank in the funds transfer chain when it acts as an originator or intermediary for a funds transferTransmitter’s Financial InstitutionIntermediary Financial InstitutionName and account number of the transmitterAll of the information included in the payment order by the transmitter’s financial institution, plus;Address of the transmitterName and address or numerical identifier of the transmitter’s financial institutionIdentity of the transmitter’s financial institutionAmount of the transmittalExecution date of the transmittal orderIdentity of the recipients’ financial institutionAnd as many of the following items as are received with the transmittal:Name and address of the recipientAccount number of the recipientOther specific identifiers of the recipientThe Bank which provides for the purchase and sale of monetary instruments must require the retention of records of cash sale to a customer for bank checks, drafts, cashier’s checks, money orders, and traveler’s checks (which the Bank does not currently sell) between $3,000 and $10,000 inclusive for five years.  These records must include evidence of verification of the identity of the purchaser and other information as outlined below:The name of the purchaser;Date of purchase;Types of instrument purchased;Serial number of the instrument purchased; The amounts in dollars of each of the instruments purchased; andVerification that the individual is a deposit holder/verification or the purchaser’s identity (address, SS#/Alien Identification #, DOB).The following records will be retained for seven years:A record of each extension of credit in an amount in excess of $10,000Each document granting signature authority over each deposit or share accountEach statement, ledger card or other record on each deposit or share account, showing each transaction in, or with respect to, that accountEach check, clean draft, or money order drawn on the Company or issued and payable by itEach item in excess of $100 comprising a debit to a customer’s deposit or share accountRecords prepared or received in the ordinary course of business, which would be needed to reconstruct a transaction account and to trace a check in excess of $100Each deposit slip or credit ticket reflecting a transaction in excess of $100.AML TrainingAnnually the Bank shall maintain a regular training program for the purpose of educating its personnel and heightening their awareness so that they will be knowledgeable and vigilant in their efforts to recognize and report activity, which may constitute money laundering.Within 60 days of hire, new employees will be trained in the basic aspect of AML.  Additionally, the new employee will be required to read and attest that they understand the contents of the Bank’s AML/BSA policies.The appropriate attendance records and training materials will be retained for three years.   Note:  Training will be conducted at least annually for the Board of Directors.BSA/AML Compliance OfficerThe BSA/AML Compliance Officer has day-to-day responsibility for managing all aspects of the Bank’s AML Program and compliance with AML laws and regulations.  The BSA/AML Compliance Officer is also responsible for the maintenance of this Policy and for considering deviations to this Policy.  In addition, the BSA/AML Compliance Officer advises staff regarding the application of anti-money laundering laws and regulations and on money laundering trends and patterns specific to certain businesses.Despite changes in management or employee composition or structure, the BSA/AML Compliance Officer will ensure that all requirements of an effective BSA/AML program are implemented and that the program contains all appropriate aspects to be in compliance with all laws and regulations. BSA/AML Risk AssessmentThe Bank has developed a risk assessment, which was approved by the Board of Directors, by identifying risks along with the associated mitigants.  The assessment will be periodically reviewed and presented to the Board for approval.Independent TestingIndependent testing commensurate with the BSA/AML risk profile of the bank will be conducted every 12 to 18 months by outside auditors.  Upon completion, the auditors conducting the BSA/AML test will report the results to the Audit Committee.Board ReportingOn an annual basis or more frequently as circumstances dictate, the BSA/AML Compliance Officer will present a report to the Board of Directors.  This report will include such important facts relating compliance initiatives, any deficiencies/corrective action noted, SAR filings relating to AML, etc.APPENDIX AEXAMPLES OF SUSPICIOUS CONDUCT AND TRANSACTIONSThe existence of one or more of these suspicious circumstances does not mean that money laundering activity is taking place, but that such circumstances should be scrutinized carefully.Customers who are reluctant to provide normal information when opening an account or who provide fictitious or conflicting information.Customers with no discernible reason for using the Bank’s services (e.g. customers with distant addresses who could find the same services nearer to home)Business customers who are reluctant to provide complete information regarding the purpose, prior banking relationships, officers or directors, or location of their business.Business customers who are reluctant to reveal details about their activities, or to provide financial statements, or whose financial statements are noticeably different from those of similar businesses.Large cash deposits by an individual or business where checks and other instruments are the expected norm.Structuring multiple cash deposits which are individually unexceptional, but significant in the aggregate.Exchanging large quantities of low denomination currencies for those of higher denomination.Deposit or withdrawal activity that is inconsistent with the activity normally associated with the customer or the customer’s type of business.Funds transfers are sent or received from the same person to or from different accounts.Funds activity is unexplained, repetitive, or shows unusual patterns.A customer uses unusual or suspicious identification documents that cannot be readily verified.The customer’s background differs from that which would be expected on the basis of his or her business activities.A customer is reluctant to provide information needed to file a mandatory report, to have the report filed, or to proceed with a transaction after being informed that the report must be filed.A person uses the automated teller machine to make several bank deposits below a specified threshold.The currency transaction activity reflected a sudden change inconsistent with normal activities.A customer purchases a number of cashier’s checks, money orders, or traveler’s checks for large amounts under a specified threshold.Suspicious movements of funds occur from one bank to another and then funds are moved back to the first bank.Deposits of large third-party checks endorsed in favor of the customer where such conduct is inconsistent with the customer’s normal activity.Large numbers of individuals making payments into the same account without adequate explanation.Unexpected repayment of problem loans.Requests to provide or arrange financing where the source of the customer’s financial contribution to a deal is unclear, particularly where property is involved.Employees whose habits or lifestyles change unexpectedlyEmployees whose performance changes unexpectedly.The stated occupation of the customer is not commensurate with the type of level of activity.Regarding nonprofit or charitable organizations, financial transactions occur for which there appears to be no logical economic purpose or in which there appears to be no link between the stated activity of the organization and the other parties in the transaction.For additional examples of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing “Red Flags” see the FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual 11/17/2014.APPENDIX BCOUNTRY TIERING

FinCEN posts on its secure website a list of individuals, entities and organizations which are under investigation by one or more federal agencies.  All financial institutions covered by 314(a) of the USA Patriot Act are required to quickly search their records to determine whether they maintain or have engaged in transactions with any of the named subjects.If the Bank finds a match with a subject named on FinCEN’s 314(a) list, the match must be reported to FinCEN by making an entry on FinCEN’s secure website no later than fourteen (14) calendar days after the list was posted.  At that point, a federal agency may follow up with a subpoena for specified documents.  That subpoena is processed like any other subpoena from law enforcement.  If the Bank has no match, no response is necessary.A search of all pertinent Bank systems that contain customer information to determine whether or not the Company has any “hits” for the names listed on the request.  The appropriate affirmative responses are entered on the FinCEN secure website.Also the pertinent account or transactional activity is analyzed, and if the filing of a SAR is warranted, a SAR is prepared and filed.All Bank employees involved in the processing and handling of 314(a) requests are required to keep the information confidential.
