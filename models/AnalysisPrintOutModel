1.	BSA/Sanctions Risk Assessment Executive Summary: Summarize the key aspects of the BSA/or Sanctions risk assessment, highlighting the main points and outcomes of the analysis.
Example: The Bank of Wall Street engaged 2920 Wall Street to conduct a comprehensive Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML) and Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) Risk Assessment. While the FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual recommends that financial institutions perform such assessments, it does not mandate a specific frequency for updating them. The Bank has proactively decided to conduct these assessments annually, ensuring that the findings are promptly communicated to its executive management and board.
The assessment covered the period from January 1 to December 31 of 2024, evaluating the bank's risk exposures and the effectiveness of its control measures, including any residual risks. The methodology used was in line with the standards set by AMLRS’s BSA/AML and OFAC Risk Assessment Methodology. The findings of this assessment are primarily based on discussions with the bank's staff and data provided by the bank, which 2920 Wall Street assumed to be accurate and reliable for the purpose of this risk assessment. However, 2920 Wall Street has not verified the accuracy or completeness of this data and therefore does not guarantee it. The information presented should be considered as indicative of risk levels rather than precise metrics, and care has been taken to avoid making estimations that could misrepresent the bank's actual risk profile.

1.1.	About the Client:  Detail company information and experience with working on this with other clients at a high-level.

1.2.	Overview: Provides an introduction to the scope and purpose of the sanctions risk assessment, outlining the context and key objectives

Example: In the risk assessment process, the Client and 2920 evaluated the inherent risks and the effectiveness of internal controls, utilizing the RA Tool from 2920 to ascertain the inherent risk ratings and the impact of mitigating factors, culminating in an assessment of the Client’s residual risk.

Risk levels were categorized into Low, Low/Moderate, Moderate, Moderate/High, and High, each defined by the stability and nature of the customer base, and the frequency of account activity changes. The risk categories include Customer, Products and Services, Transaction, Geography, and Employee. These were expanded to encompass specific aspects such as Customer Stability, Customer Type, Electronic Banking, Extended Products and Services, Funds Transfer, Currency Transaction, International/Cross-Border Transactions, Geographic location, High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA)/High-Intensity Financial Crime Areas (HIFCA), and Personnel.

The BSA Compliance Officer of the Client played a critical role in this assessment, aiming to address any shortcomings and enhance the control framework. The findings are intended to be communicated clearly to the Board of Directors, aiding in strategic decision-making regarding risk tolerance, resource allocation for mitigating high-risk exposures, and ensuring the establishment of a comprehensive BSA/AML and OFAC Compliance Program aligned with the Client’s risk profile.

1.3.	Methodology of the AI-Based Risk Assessment Tool: The AI-Based Risk Assessment (RA) Tool, developed for the Client by 2920 Wall Street, LLC, employs a sophisticated methodology to evaluate the Client’s BSA/AML and OFAC risk profiles. This tool integrates advanced algorithms and customized formulas to systematically assess and score the various dimensions of risk. Here’s an overview of the methodology employed by the RA Tool:

1.3.1.	Risk Identification and Scoring
The tool begins with a comprehensive identification of risk categories relevant to the Client’s operations. It examines the Client’s customer base, transaction types, product offerings, geographic locations, and other factors that influence BSA/AML and OFAC risks. Each risk category is then quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed to assign a preliminary Probability Score, reflecting the likelihood of risk occurrence based on the clients risk profile.
1.3.2.	Inherent Risk Evaluation
Inherent risks are assessed without considering the mitigating controls in place. The tool calculates an Inherent Risk Score for each category based on factors like customer demographics, product risk levels, transaction volumes, and geographic exposure. This scoring helps in identifying areas of high vulnerability to money laundering, terrorist financing, sanctions, or fraud.
1.3.3.	Mitigation and Control Analysis
The tool evaluates the Client’s risk management framework, examining policies, procedures, and controls established to mitigate identified risks. Each control mechanism is scored against corresponding inherent risks to determine the effectiveness of the Client’s risk mitigation strategies. This phase produces a Risk Mitigation and Controls Score for each risk category.
1.3.4.	Residual Risk Calculation
The RA Tool synthesizes data from the previous phases to derive a Residual Risk Score for each risk category. This score reflects the remaining risk level after applying the Client’s mitigating controls. The tool uses custom-developed formulas to combine the scores of inherent risk and mitigating controls, thus determining the residual risk.
1.3.5.	Reporting and Analysis
The tool facilitates the generation of detailed reports that provide insights into the Client’s risk profile. These reports include scores and ratings for inherent, mitigating, and residual risks across all assessed categories. Analysts use these reports to discuss findings with the Client’s management, ensuring accurate reflection of the risk landscape and facilitating informed decision-making.
The RA Tool’s methodology is underpinned by its ability to capture and analyze vast amounts of data, translating complex risk factors into actionable intelligence. This AI-driven approach ensures a dynamic, comprehensive, and nuanced assessment of the Client’s risk profile, supporting strategic risk management and regulatory compliance.

1.4.	Five-Phase Approach to BSA/AML and OFAC Risk Assessment: This section is used directly in the final draft as methodology for conducting the RA. It will serve as evidence of the process.

1.1.1.	 Phase One: Risk Identification and Evaluation
In the initial phase, the assessment team identifies and evaluates the levels of BSA/AML and OFAC risks faced by the Client. This evaluation involves a detailed analysis of the Client’s customer demographics, product and service offerings, transactional patterns, geographical footprint, and the nature of customer relationships. A Probability Score is generated to quantify the likelihood of risk occurrences in each category.
1.1.2.	 Phase Two: Inherent Risk Analysis
In phase two, the focus is on evaluating the Client's exposure to inherent risks associated with money laundering, terrorist financing, sanctions, devoid of any mitigating controls. Each risk category is analyzed and assigned a score reflecting the Client's vulnerability. An Inherent Risk Score is then produced, encapsulating these evaluations.
1.1.3.	 Phase Three: Control and Mitigation Framework Assessment
This phase involves a comprehensive review of the Client’s control mechanisms and strategies for mitigating identified risks. The effectiveness and robustness of these controls are scored for each risk category, aiding in the assessment of the Client’s capabilities in managing and mitigating risks. A Risk Mitigation and Controls Score is computed to summarize these capabilities across all categories.
1.1.4.	 Phase Four: Overall Risk Rating Determination
During this phase, the assessment tool synthesizes the data from the earlier phases to generate overall ratings for inherent risk, control effectiveness, and residual risk for each category. The inherent risk rating gauges the potential risk level, the controls rating evaluates the Client’s preparedness and mitigation strategies, and the residual risk rating measures the remaining risk after all controls have been applied.
1.1.5.	 Phase Five: Results Reporting and Review
The final phase involves a thorough review of the preliminary risk assessment findings with the Client’s management and relevant officers to ensure accuracy and comprehensiveness. Any necessary adjustments are made based on these discussions, leading to the drafting of a report. This draft is shared for further review and, following any additional modifications, the final risk assessment report is formalized and distributed.
1.5.	Key Findings and Recommendations: The key findings from the risk assessment process shed light on critical insights and the potential impact of various risk factors on the Client’s operations. These findings include gaps in risk coverage, discrepancies between inherent risk levels and control mechanisms, and areas where enhancements are necessary to mitigate risks effectively.

1.6.	Uncovered Inherent Risks with Insufficient Documentation (Finding): One significant reason for providing a finding is the identification of inherent risks that are not adequately documented or covered in the Client's risk assessment submissions. For instance, the assessment may reveal high-risk activities or customer segments that lack comprehensive monitoring or control documentation, indicating a gap in the risk management framework.

1.7.	Disproportionate Risk and Control Levels (Finding): The assessment often uncovers instances where the level of inherent risk is high, but the corresponding controls are rated as low or inadequate. This discrepancy points to potential vulnerabilities in the risk management strategy, necessitating a thorough review and enhancement of control measures.

1.8.	Need for Enhanced Training and Awareness: The findings may also highlight the need for improved training and awareness programs, particularly in areas where high inherent risks are identified. This is crucial for ensuring that all personnel are equipped with the necessary knowledge and tools to manage these risks effectively.

1.9.	Recommendations for System Model or Procedure Enhancements (Recommendation): For areas where the inherent risk is high and controls are not sufficiently robust, the assessment will recommend specific enhancements. These may include the development of new system models to better detect and mitigate risks or the revision of existing procedures to strengthen the control environment.

1.10.	Strategic Recommendations for Risk Appetite Alignment: The assessment will provide strategic recommendations to align the Client’s risk management practices with its risk appetite. This includes suggesting adjustments in risk tolerance levels and implementing more stringent controls in areas of high inherent risk.

These key findings and recommendations serve as a roadmap for the Client to enhance its risk management framework, ensuring that all inherent risks are adequately controlled and that the institution remains compliant with BSA/AML and OFAC regulations.

Example: BSA/AML Risk Assessment Results
The Client's inherent BSA/AML risk was assessed as Moderate/High, with the residual risk rating settled at Moderate. This assessment encompassed an evaluation of the Client’s member base, including entities with elevated BSA/AML risks such as Money Service Businesses, non-government organizations, and certain foreign entities. The analysis factored in the variety of services offered, like online banking and electronic funds transfer, and geographical considerations, especially given the locations in high-risk areas.

The evaluation considered the Client’s control mechanisms, including BSA/AML policies, training programs, and technology use.
