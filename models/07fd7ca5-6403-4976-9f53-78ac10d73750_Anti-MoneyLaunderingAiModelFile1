It also identifies a set of money laundering risk ratings, and includes standards for performing account surveillance, and maintaining records.Non-compliance with the requirements of this policy could seriously undermine the reputation of and public confidence in the Bank and could result in disciplinary actions against the Bank and its employees, including civil and criminal penalties and other sanctions.The U.S. Congress enacted the Bank Secrecy Act in October 1970 to prevent banks and other financial service providers from being used as intermediaries to hide the transfer or deposit of money derived from criminal activity.  Since its passage, Congress has amended the BSA a number of times to enhance law enforcement effectiveness.  The reporting and recordkeeping requirements of the BSA regulations create a paper trail for law enforcement to investigate money laundering schemes and other illegal activities.  This paper trail operates to deter illegal activity and provides a means to trace movements of money through the financial system.The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (USA PATRIOT Act) was signed into law by President Bush on October 26, 2001, and contains strong measures to prevent, detect, and prosecute terrorist financing and international money laundering.  Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act is the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001.  It includes provisions for fighting international money laundering and blocking terrorist access to the U.S. financial systems.  ObjectivesThe primary objective of this Policy is to help protect the good name and reputation of the Bank, and to secure its premises and systems against misuse as a vehicle for money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illegal activities.  Specific objectives include the following:To ensure compliance with applicable U.S. and local anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing laws and regulations while protecting the financial privacy and relationship between the Bank and its customersTo establish minimum standards needed to determine and verify the identity of new customers and any other relevant account parties, and to require the application of enhanced due diligence standards to those customers considered higher-risk as a matter of law or regulations, or based upon the Bank’s own assessment of riskTo set appropriate standards for the ongoing conduct of customer relationshipsTo institute sound account/transaction surveillance standards as a mechanism for enabling Bank personnel to recognize, detect, and report money laundering, terrorist financing, and/or suspicious activity occurring through Bank accountsTo delineate the responsibilities of employees who implement the Bank’s AML processes.PolicyThe Bank will comply with the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), the USA PATRIOT Act, and other applicable AML laws and regulations.  Also the Bank, consistent with applicable law, cooperates with governmental and law enforcement authorities in the enforcement of AML laws and regulations in connection with transactions involving the Bank.No director, officer or employee of the Company shall:Knowingly engage in, or assist any other person or entity in engaging in, any activity believed by such director, officer or employee to involve money laundering, terrorist financing or other suspicious or criminal activityAssist any customer in structuring financial transactions in order to avoid disclosure to governmental or law enforcement authorities under applicable lawAdvise any customer that their information has been, or will be, reported to governmental or law enforcement authorities (unless informing the customer is permissible, such as during the preparation of a Currency Transaction Report)Make a conscious decision to avoid learning the truth about a customer’s suspected illegal activities.Any director, officer or employee of the Company who fails to adhere to any of the foregoing policies may be subject to immediate demotion, reassignment or dismissal, and such failure may cause such individual and the Bank to be subject to severe civil and/or criminal penalties.Money Laundering and Terrorist FinancingMoney Laundering is the involvement in any one transaction, or series of transactions, which assists a person in keeping, concealing or disposing of the proceeds derived from illegal activities.  It is the criminal act of processing “dirty” money, through a series of transactions; in this way the funds are “cleaned” so that they appear to be proceeds from legal activities.  Refer to Appendix A for examples of suspicious conduct and transactions related to money launderingAlthough money laundering is a complex process, it basically involves the following three steps that can occur independently or simultaneously:The first stage of laundering money is placement.  The goal is to introduce the unlawful proceeds into the financial system without attracting the attention of financial institutions or law enforcement.  Placement techniques include structuring currency deposits in an amount to evade reporting requirements or commingling currency deposits of legal and illegal enterprises.  An example may include dividing large amounts of currency such as purchasing a series of monetary instruments.The second stage of the money laundering process is layering, which involves moving funds around the financial system, often in a complex series of transactions, to create confusion.  Examples of layering include wiring funds to and through numerous accounts at many institutions.The final stage of the process is integration.  Once the funds are in the financial system and obstructed through the layering stage, the integration stage is used to further create the appearance of legal funds through additional transactions.  Examples include the real estate transactions or investment securities.Terrorists generally finance their activities through both unlawful and legitimate sources.  Unlawful activities, such as extortion, kidnapping, and drug trafficking, have been found to be a major source of funding.  Other observed activities include improper use of charitable or relief funds that donors may have no knowledge that their donations have been diverted to support terrorist causes.  Other legitimate sources have also been found to provide terrorist organizations with funding; these legitimate sources are a key difference between terrorist financiers and traditional criminal organizations.Prohibited CountriesThe Bank may determine that it will not process transactions involving certain countries, or maintain or open new accounts for clients located in certain countries, because of publicly reported concerns of law enforcement agencies and regulators with respect to money laundering controls in those countries.  As events change, the Bank may add or delete countries from this prohibition.Refer to Appendix B for Countries Tiering List         .Know Your Customer StandardsSound business practices include the concept of knowing your customer.  Observing the standards within this Policy can greatly reduce the risk that the Bank might be used for unlawful purposes.  A sound Know Your Customer Policy include, at a minimum:Establishing the true identity of the customer and other related parties to the account, as appropriateScreening customer and, as appropriate, related party names against government listsObtaining additional information/documentation as needed to understand the customer’s level of risk, determine the need for enhanced due diligence, and enable the detection of suspicious activityDetermining the customer source of fundsUnderstanding and recording the account’s purpose and anticipated transaction behaviorMaintaining up-to-date knowledge of the customer through ongoing client contact and periodic reviews.Prohibited CustomersThe Bank intends to do business with reputable customers whose identity can be verified.  The Bank will not knowingly do business with persons or entities with whom the Bank is prohibited from doing business because they are sanctioned under the U.S. Embargo Programs or any other official government lists that are identified and distributed throughout the Bank or are applicable in the local jurisdiction.  Also those with whom the Company has chosen not to do business based on prior experience.  In addition, Shell Banks which is one that does not have a physical presence in any country.  Physical presence is defined as a place of business that (1) is maintained by a non-U.S. bank; (2) is located at a fixed address in a country in which the non-U.S. bank is authorized to conduct banking activities, at which location the non-U.S. bank employs one or more individuals on a full-time basis and maintains operating records related to its banking activities; and (3) is subject to inspection by the banking authority that licensed the non-U.S. bank to conduct banking activities.Also, the Bank will not knowingly do business with individuals or entities:Whose character or financial conduct are suspect at the inception of the relationship or becomes suspect at any time during the relationshipConvicted of money laundering or related financial crimeWho attempt to establish anonymous accounts, accounts in obviously fictitious names or accounts where the identity of the true beneficial owner of the funds is required but cannot be obtainedWho refuse to provide information required by the BankCustomer Identification Program (CIP)Minimum identifying information must be obtained, recorded and verified for any new customer prior to opening their first account or providing their first product/service.  For the purpose of CIP requirements, a customer is defined as any person, including both individuals and entities (e.g., corporations, partnerships and trusts), that opens a new account, product or service, including deposit, transaction, asset, securities, safekeeping, collateral, or mutual fund accounts, credit, lending or borrowing activities, a safe deposit box, or cash management, custody, trust or estate services.  Typically, the customer is the accountholder.  In cases where an individual opens an account on behalf of a person who lacks legal capacity, such as a minor or an entity that is not a legal person, the individual opening the account is the customer.  The following entities are excluded from the definition of customer for CIP purposes:Financial institutions regulated by a U.S. Federal functional regulator or banks regulated by a U.S. state bank regulatorDepartments or agencies of the U.S., including any state or political subdivision of any stateEntities established under the laws of the U.S., state laws, political subdivision of any state, or under an interstate compact, that exercise governmental authority on behalf of the U.S., or any such State or political subdivisionPublicly listed entities whose common stock or similar equity interests are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, or the NASDAQ Stock Market.For new customers who are individuals, including joint accountholders, the following identification information must be obtained and recorded:NameDate of birthPrimary residence address (and mailing address, if different from residence address).  For a customer who does not have a residential or mailing address, a business street address, an Army Post Office or Fleet Post Office box number or the residential or business address of next of kin or of another contact individualGovernment issued identification number – For U.S. individuals, this number must be the Social Security Number.  For non-U.S. individuals/foreign based individuals, the number can be a taxpayer identification number, passport number, national identification number, resident’s identification number, alien identification number, or another government-issued identification number.For new customers who are entities, the following identification information must be obtained and recorded:Legal namePrincipal place of business address (or local office address)Government issued identification number – For U.S. entities (established or organized in the U.S.), this number must be the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN/Employer Identification Number (EIN).  For non-U.S. entities/foreign based individuals, this number can be a taxpayer identification number, registration number, or another government-issued identification number.  Alternative government-issued documentation that certifies existence must be requested for any non-U.S. entities that do not have an identification number.There may be instances (i.e., a newly formed entity) when the customer has applied for the TIN/EIN, but it has not been received at the time the account is requested.  In all cases, the TIN/EIN must be obtained by the Bank within 60 days or the account must be closed.  The Bank will track accounts opened without TINs/EINs, and may consider restricting account usage, such as limiting deposits, withdrawals, check writing, extension of credit or other measures while receipt of the TIN/EIN is pending.The identification of each customer is typically verified before or at account opening.  For all businesses, verification must be accomplished no later than 30 days after account opening.  Identity verification can be accomplished through documentary or non-documentary means or a combination of both.  Depending on the risks associated with the customer, businesses may consider whether to restrict the customer’s activities until such time that the verification has been completed.Documentary verification is accomplished by obtaining, reviewing, and making a record of one acceptable form of identification document.  For individual customers, acceptable identification documents include unexpired, government-issued photo IDs, such as:PassportDriver’s license or non-driver photo ID cardMilitary ID cardFor businesses/entities, acceptable identification documents include:Certificate of Incorporation/Filing ReceiptGeneral or Limited Partnership AgreementArticles of Organization or Association/Certification of FormationTrust InstrumentLetters of Trusteeship or ExecutorshipU.S. Internal Revenue Code Sec. 501(c)(3) letter (for nonprofit organizations)A government-issued business licenseFor foreign based entities, those legal documents issued by other countries that parallel the above and authenticate the entity will be accepted upon verification.These documents are to be used to confirm the accuracy of the information provided by new customers.  A record of the document(s) used must be retained on file and should include:  a description (i.e., the type of document), its identification number, the place of issuance, the date of issuance, and the expiration date (as applicable).  A photocopy of the document (should the business choose to make and retain photocopies) will satisfy this requirement. Refer to Appendix C for further description of documentary verification documents         The Bank may choose to perform non-documentary verification in addition to, or instead of, placing reliance on the documents named above.  Non-documentary verification may include, but is not limited to:Contacting the customer at home after the relationship has been establishedObtaining references from reliable sources (e.g., credit bureaus, other financial institutions)Performing a site visit at the entity customer’s place of business.Even when not required, non-documentary verification may be considered an additional safeguard, particularly in higher-risk businesses and with high-risk customers.  When non-documentary verification is used, a record must be made and retained of the methods undertaken to verify the identity of a customer; this record should include a description of the methods and the results of verification performed.During the course of verifying the identity of a customer, discrepancies may arise between the information obtained from the customer and the information obtained during the verification.  Resolutions resulting in the continuing the relationship need to be further documented and approved by a Vice President or above.Bank employees are under no obligation to continue the customer identification and verification process if, at any time during this process, they determine that it is in the best interest of the Bank to terminate the relationship or discontinue the customer acceptance process.  If the decision to discontinue customer acceptance is based on a CIP failure and is deemed suspicious, an Incident Report Form must be filed even though accounts are not opened.The USA PATRIOT Act requires that, prior to opening an account that the Bank notify its customers that it will be requesting information to verify their identity.  The Bank’s signage/brochure will include the following language:Important Information About Procedures For Opening a New AccountTo help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, financial institutions are required by Federal law to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each individual or entity that opens an account or requests credit.What this means for individuals:  When an individual opens an account or requests credit, we will ask for their name, residence address, date of birth, tax identification number, and other information that allows us to identify them.  We may also ask to see a driver’s license, passport or other identifying documents.New Account ReviewWithin five business days, the branch manager or designee will review new account information and supporting documentation to determine whether all the necessary information was obtained, the account appears suspicious in any manner, the risk rating is proper and the type of account/business/customer is in compliance with bank policy.  Also as part of this review, the branch manager or designee validates the information on the Insight system to ensure accuracy.  The branch manager or designee signs the “Account Opening Data Entry Form” as evidence of the review and approval.OFAC Screening/Comparison with Government ListsUpon opening an account, the related party names are screened against the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanction list.  Upon receipt of an update of the OFAC sanction list, the entire portfolio is scanned against this sanction list.  Possible matches are investigated and any true matches are escalated to the OFAC Compliance Officer for resolution.The new account will also be scanned to determine whether the customer appears on any list, should one be issued, of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations issued by any Federal government agency and designated as such by Treasury in consultation with the Federal functional regulators.  Possible matches are investigated and any true matches are escalated to the BSA/AML Compliance Officer.  The BSA/AML Compliance Officer is responsible to ensure that all federal directives issued in connection with these lists are followed.KYC Due Diligence RequirementsKYC due diligence must be performed on all new customers at the time the relationship with the Bank is first established.  For the purposes of KYC, the customer is each person in whose name an account is opened or a product/service is initiated.  This person can be an individual, a company, an organization or other entity.  The Bank will obtain information and perform due diligence on related parties where appropriate.  Related parties include persons who have authority, or who are in a position of control, over the account, product or service, as well as the beneficial owner(s) of the assets and persons who are intended to receive a benefit from, or be a recipient under, the relationship.  The following are some examples of related parties:The account’s nominal and/or beneficial owner(s)For an account in the name of an agent, the principalFor a company account, the significant owners, principal officers, key senior managers, and directors of the companyFor an account in the name of a trust, the donor, trustees, and executors.When opening a new account for an existing customer, it is not necessary to re-perform customer identification/verification steps provided that the existing customer information is current and complete and the Bank maintains the reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of the customer.  Additional account level data, however, may be needed in certain circumstances relative to any additional accounts offered to existing customers.  Similar account level data may also be necessary when a new account is opened for a new customer.  Depending on the type of account, such additional information may include, but is not limited to:Type and purpose of accountSource of initial and ongoing fundingAnticipated activity:  the anticipated usage, activity, types of transactions, volumes and dollar amountsBeneficial Ownership Rule:CRB staff is required to identify the beneficial owners of their legal entity customers-including corporations, limited liability companies, partnerships, business trusts, any other entity created by a filing with a state office, any similar entities formed under the laws of a non-US jurisdiction and similar entities-that open new accounts. The definition of “legal entity customer” does not include:Natural personsSole ProprietorshipsUnincorporated Associations (i.e. Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, neighborhood associations)Trusts, other than statutory trusts created by a filing with a state officeSpecifically, CRB must identify and verify Beneficial owners defined as: one or more natural persons, if any, who directly or indirectly own 25% or more of a legal entity customer, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, and; a natural person who "controls" the entity with significant responsibility to control, manage, or direct a legal entity customer, including:An executive officer or senior manager (e.g., a Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Managing Member, General Partner, President, Vice President, or Treasurer); or any other individual who regularly performs similar functions.Certain legal entities, including the following, are excluded from the Beneficial Ownership Rule:Domestic banks in the United States (including domestic offices of foreign banks);Entities listed on the New York, American, or NASDAQ stock exchanges;Majority-owned subsidiaries of such listed entities;Security issuers registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;Investment companies;SEC- and CFTC- registered entities;Bank holding companies;Pooled investment vehicles operated by an entity that is not a legal entity customer;State-regulated insurance companies;Designated financial market utilities;Foreign financial institutions whose regulator maintains beneficial ownership information;Foreign government entities that do not engage in commercial activities; andLegal entities only to the extent that they open a private bank accountInternal Account Requests:  The following policies apply when a bank employee submits an account opening request to the branch manager.The person submitting the form (i.e. the person signing the “Requested by” field) to the branch manager will be the Relationship Owner of the account.The Relationship Owner will be responsible for completing the following:Gathering and ensuring that all information is complete to support the opening of the account;Determining the money laundering risk ratingAny updating of Know Your Customer (KYC) information.  The Relationship Owner updates the KYC information, when there is a significant change in customer activity (for example new products added, or increase in transaction volume), ownership, or public information about the customer.  Completing the periodic review - For high risk customers, the periodic review occurs one per year, whereas for medium risk customers, the periodic review occurs once every two years (based on the date the account was opened).  Conducting site visits of high risk customers, in case there is a triggering event.  Triggering events include:  negative news; unusual increase/decrease in account activity; changes in the nature of the account activity; money laundering alerts that cannot be cleared; word of mouth tips; or reluctance from customer to provide information.  Refer to Appendix D for a sample of the Internal New Account Request formMoney Laundering Risk RatingsMoney laundering risk ratings are an evaluation of the customer’s/account’s potential money laundering risk.  As such, they can impact the approvals needed to accept a customer or open the account, determine the extent of information and verification required, trigger the need for enhanced due diligence, and affect the frequency of periodic relationship reviews.The relationship owner determines the money laundering risk rating but will be reviewed by another individual.  Money laundering risk ratings must be determined before a new customer is accepted, and at, or immediately after, a new account is opened.  They are to be re-evaluated and adjusted, as appropriate, during the periodic review process, or at any other time when the business learns of new information that affects the rating.  The branch manager is responsible for reviewing or approving changes to a client’s risk rating.Money laundering risk ratings apply at both the customer and account level.  If a customer is high-risk by himself, because for example he is a politically exposed person or associated with a high-risk industry, then all of his accounts should be classified as high-risk.  If an account is rated high-risk, however, the associated customer is not automatically high-risk.Risk determination is a two-part process.  First, the relationship owner must identify and understand the general operating and overall legal, regulatory and geopolitical environments in which their customers operate.  Second, the relationship owner must, at a minimum, understand the following to determine whether they want to enter into, or sustain, a relationship with a particular customer within their target market:The nature of the customer, including their reputation and business or other financial activitiesThe products and services requested, and the customer’s purpose for and use of such products and servicesThe money laundering risks associated with the customer and the jurisdiction(s) with which the customer has significant contact.Also the following risk factors will be considered:Customer-Type – At a minimum, the following customers shall be considered high-risk:  Politically Exposed Persons, Money Services Businesses, Offshore International Business Corporations and Private Investment Companies, any customers associated with substantial negative public information.Geography – At a minimum, customers associated with (i.e., located/domiciled in, a citizen or resident of, and/or has business activities in) a Tier 1 country shall be considered high-risk.  Refer to Appendix B for the Country Tiering ListIndustry – At a minimum, customers associated with (i.e., one is principally engaged in or whose source of wealth was generated from) a high-risk industry shall be considered high-risk.  Refer to Appendix E for the High- and Medium-Risk Industries ListProducts and Services – At a minimum, customers and/or accounts that use high-risk products or services shall be considered high-risk.  Refer to Appendix F for the Medium Risk Products ListTransaction Activity – Such as whether the customer’s expected transaction activity, including cash and/or wire activity, is determined to be high.Money Laundering Risk Ratings for New Online Accounts[Insert Financial Institution Here] recognizes that accounts which are opened without face-to-face or phone contact may pose a higher risk for money laundering for the following reasons:More difficult to positively verify the individual’s identity;Customer may be out of [Insert Financial Institution Here]’s targeted geographic area;Customer may perceive the transactions as less transparent;Transactions are instantaneous; and/orMay be used by a “front” company or unknown third party.The Bank will obtain the same information as it would for a face-to-face account opening and will use ChexSystems’ QualiFile electronic inquiry response to authenticate identity.  The Bank has limited the geographic availability to New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.  Due to the above considerations, all new online accounts will be deemed medium risk for the first three (3) months and if there is no unusual activity for that time period, then the account will be changed to low risk.  Pursuant to the Bank’s two (2) year periodic review process for medium risk accounts, if the customer’s activity warrants a change in risk rating, then the Bank will act accordingly.  Please refer to the Bank’s Account Create Procedures. Additional KYC Due Diligence Requirements for Certain Customers, Related Parties, and AccountsNew High-Risk CustomersAll new customer relationships that are deemed high-risk, and those escalated from medium or low to high-risk, are subject to review by the AML Officer.  The Standard Account Review Sheet is subject to completion, and review based on established requirements.  If, upon review, the AML officer deems that the Bank cannot continue with this relationship, the AML officer will make a recommendation to close the account.  Any decision to keep the account open after such recommendation will require approval from the Chairman of the Board.Refer to Appendix G for Standard Account Review SheetPolitically Exposed PersonsCustomers/related parties who are Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) increase the risk that the Bank could be exposed to involvement in money laundering or other illegal activities.  The financial activities of PEPs may be of public interest or might otherwise attract publicity within or beyond the borders of their home country, and their transactions with the Bank could potentially involve the proceeds of foreign official corruption.  If the Bank knowingly engages in financial transactions in violation of the money laundering laws of various jurisdictions, the Company will be exposed to significant legal and reputational harm.PEPs are defined as a U.S. or non-U.S., current or former, senior official of the executive, legislative, administrative, military or judicial branches of a government, whether elected or not and include senior officials of a major political party or a senior executive of a government-owned commercial enterprise.  A senior official or executive is defined as an individual with substantial authority over policy, operations, or the use of government owned services.  PEP positions include, but are not limited to:Heads of State, Government Heads or National Leaders, such as the President, Prime Minister, King, Queen, Emir, Sultan, Emperor, Monarch, PopeNational Cabinet Members and Department/Agency Heads, such as the Vice President, Chancellor, Secretary of State, Defense Minister, Chief of the Treasury, Head of the National Bank, and other key Department, Agency, Ministry, and Office OfficialsKey National Legislative Officials, such as Congressmen, Senators, House Representatives, Parliament members, Assemblymen, CouncilmenSenior Military Leaders, such as the Army SecretaryImportant National Justices, such as the Attorney General, Chief Justices, and Associate JudgesPolitical Party LeadersAmbassadors/Consuls General, including the United Nation RepresentativeGovernorsMayors of cities with populations in excess of 1MMSenior executives of government-owned enterprises, such as the Chairman, CEO and President of government airline.The following customers/related parties are also PEPs and are therefore bound by the requirements of this section:Corporations, businesses or entities formed by, or for the benefit of, or significantly owned or controlled by, a PEP; significant ownership is 25% or more; control includes holding a senior executive position of influence, such as the Chairman, CEO, and PresidentAny immediate family member of a PEP, including the spouse, parents, siblings, children, and spouses’ parents or siblingsA person who is widely and publicly known to be a close associate of any such individualForeign Embassies/Consulates/MinistriesForeign political organizations.Upon account opening, reasonable steps will be taken to determine whether customers and related parties are PEPs including the direct inquiry with the customer.  The customer’s KYC profile and account record must indicate that the client is a PEP.Enhanced scrutiny is required whenever the Bank does business with a PEP.  This enhanced scrutiny includes the following:Determining the identity of the PEPAssessing the level of corruption and characteristics associated with the PEP’s countryEvaluating the PEP’s position, length of time in office, and reputationProbing the PEP’s employment history and source of funds and wealthObtaining information on immediate family members or close associates having transaction authority over the accountUnderstanding the purpose of the account and expected volumes and nature of account activityConsidering the use of the account(s)Performing appropriate database/internet checks to gather informationObtaining Board of Directors approval before account opening (presentation to outline the nature of the request, explanation of the rationale for initiating or maintaining the PEP relationship and providing adequate information regarding the PEP, the due diligence steps taken in regard to the relationship and how the PEP’s ongoing activities with Bank will be monitored.)On an annual basis, each Business Head must review the PEPs in his or her business to determine if their retention continues to be appropriate.  This review must be evidenced in writing. Refer to “PEP Scanning Procedures” for detailed processes for identifying Politically Exposed Persons.Money Services BusinessesMoney Service Businesses (MSBs) are high-risk because many:Lack ongoing customer relationships and require minimal or no identification of customersMaintain limited or inconsistent recordkeeping on customers and transactionsEngage in frequent currency transactionsAre subject to varying levels of regulatory requirements and oversightCan quickly change their product mix or location and quickly enter or exit an operationSometimes operate with improper registration or licensingMSBs are defined as any person doing business, whether or not on a regular basis or as an organized business concern, in one or more of the following capacities:Currency dealer or exchangerCheck casher, including “payday” loan and check cashing servicesIssuer of traveler’s checks, money orders or stored value productsSeller or redeemer of traveler’s checks, money orders or stored value products (including the United States Postal Service)Money transmitterIt is the policy of the Bank not to do business with MSBs, except for:U.S. or state-regulated mortgage banking firmsRecognized national or regional retail chain stores whose principal business is not money services.For any other MSBs, Board of Directors approval is required.  In addition, the following baseline due diligence must be performed for all MSB relationships:Confirm that the MSB is registered with FinCENConfirm state and local licensing, if applicableConfirm agent status, if applicableConduct an on-site visitDetermine and review the ownership or senior management of the MSB.Conducting a risk assessment of the MSBConfirmation of MSB’s understanding that it will be subject to federal and state bank regulatory oversight in connection with activities conducted with and through CRBDetermining whether necessary insurance coverage, continuity plans, policies and procedures are in placeIdentifying the MSB’s customers’ profile, potential issues, risks and concerns, and areas of customer complaintsDetermining whether any conflicts of interest exist between management and insiders of CRB; Developing an MSB questionnaire to obtain additional information about each customer’s business. The questionnaire will ask the customer for information on its products and services, customer base, types of software used, employee training procedures, and other information; and Requesting copies of the MSB’s BSA/AML and OFAC policies and procedures. IT due diligence (depending on customer’s business model)As part of its ongoing due diligence, the Bank will conduct periodic site visits of MSB customers.  In addition, MSB customers are required to periodically furnish the bank with: updated, board approved policies and procedures; and independent review of the BSA/AML program and management response.  Refer to the “MSB White Paper” for details regarding MSB due diligence.Hedge FundsHedge funds may be higher-risk because they provide customers with offshore investment vehicles.  Hedge funds are similar to mutual funds in that they both are pooled investment vehicles that accept investors’ money and generally invest it on a collective basis.  Hedge funds differ significantly from mutual funds, however, because hedge funds are not regulated.Before opening an account for a hedge fund, the following due diligence will be performed:Obtain and review a prospectus, offering document or other documentation describing the fundRecord the name of and background information for the investment advisor/management company and/or the general partners or other similar senior officers, such as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Chief Information Officer, etc.Perform OFAC screenings on the fund, the investment advisor/management company, and/or the general partners or other similar senior officers by conducting Internet research or another similar service or third-party confirmation.Onboarding of Peer-to-Peer Lending Companies[Insert Financial Institution Here] will partner with one or several Peer-To-Peer Lending Companies (“P2P”) to issue unsecured consumer and business loans to borrowers with certain credit profiles.  The Bank requires each P2P lending company to develop and implement a written BSA/AML program that is reasonably designed to prevent the company from being used to facilitate money laundering or the financing of terrorist activities.  At a minimum, the anti-money laundering program shall:  provide for policies and procedures to prevent money laundering and detect suspicious activity; designate a compliance officer; provide for ongoing training of appropriate persons; and provide for periodic independent testing of the AML program.  The Bank also requires each P2P lending company to adopt a Customer Identification Program that is in compliance with the Bank’s Customer Identification policies.  The selection of the P2P lending companies will be based on, but not limited to, the following:Adequacy of BSA/AML policies and proceduresReview of results from compliance, BSA/AML and IT auditsBank management will request that BSA/AML audits be performed prior to the commencement of any funding.

Reliance, for purposes of such safe harbor, is appropriate when the other financial institution has established a similar banking/business relationship with the customer to that of the Company and when such reliance can be considered reasonable under the circumstances.  In order to be able to rely on the customer identification procedures of another financial institution, the other entity:Must be subject to the AML program requirements set forth in the USA PATRIOT Act and implementing regulationsMust be regulated by a U.S. Federal functional regulator, andMust enter into a contract with the Bank requiring the other financial institution to certify annually that it has implemented its AML program and that it, or its agent, will perform the customer identification and verification program requirements.In instances in which the intermediary to be relied upon is not subject to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act, that intermediary:Must be subject to money laundering control requirements under its local laws and regulationsMust be regulated by a recognizable financial services regulator in the country of jurisdictionMust provide a letter of attestation to the Bank in which its attests to its compliance with all appropriate customer identification, verification, and other due diligence requirements.In all cases in which a business is placing reliance upon an intermediary for the performance of any customer identification or other KYC due diligence steps, the prior, written approval must be obtained from the BSA/AML Compliance Officer.

Such examination of these daily reports must be evidenced by the reviewer by initialing the Daily Account Review Log or the report printout.In order to monitor ongoing wire transfer records quarterly, the branch manager/designee will review the Wire Transfer Velocity Report for questionable and/or unusual patterns.  Particular attention will be paid to incidents where:Unexplained or sudden extensive wire activity, especially in accounts that had little or no previous activity;A large number of wire transfers to or from unrelated third parties inconsistent with the customer’s legitimated business purpose;Wire transfers that have no apparent business purpose to or from a foreign country;The customer’s account has inflows of funds or other assets well beyond the known income or resources of the customer;Transactions in which the primary beneficiary or counter-party is undisclosed. The branch manager/designee will sign the quarterly report as evidence that the quarterly review was conducted.Unusual Activity Detected by a P2P Lending Company:  Each Peer-To-Peer Lending Company (P2P) that [Insert Financial Institution Here] (the Bank) partners with is required to have an Anti-money Laundering program.  As part of the program, the P2P lending company must have policies and procedures to detect and identify suspicious activity.  When a P2P lending company identifies suspicious activity, they notify the Loan Service Department at [Insert Financial Institution Here] of the unusual activity.  The Loan Service Department works with the P2P lending company to prepare an Incident Report.   A Compliance Analyst and the Bank’s AML/BSA Officer, review the incident report to determine whether the activity warrants a Suspicious Activity Report filing.    Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) Filing:   Upon detection of unusual activity, it is the Bank’s policy to file a SAR with respect to:Criminal violations involving insider abuse in any amount;Criminal violations aggregating $5,000 or more when a suspect can be identified;Criminal violations aggregating $25,000 or more regardless of a potential suspect;Transactions conducted or attempted by, at, or through the bank (or an affiliate) and aggregating $5,000 or more, if the bank or affiliate knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect the transaction:May involve potential money laundering or other illegal activity;Is designed to evade the BSA or its implementing regulations;Has no business or apparent lawful purpose, or is not the type of transaction that the particular customer would normally be expected to engage in, and the Bank knows of no reasonable explanation for the transaction after examining the available facts, including the background and possible purpose of the transaction.Note:  Because elderly individuals experience declining cognitive or physical abilities, they are more reliant on specific individuals for their physical well-being, financial management, and social interaction.  Therefore, certain elderly individuals may be particularly vulnerable to identity theft, embezzlement, and fraudulent schemes.  See Appendix I for Possible Signs of Elder Financial Exploitation.An investigation will be conducted for any activity deemed suspicious and if necessary, a SAR will be filed.  This Policy provides for a process of periodic, risk-based customer relationship reviews.  In the absence of an event that calls immediate attention to a relationship or to activity in the customer’s accounts, the periodic review provides the Bank with the opportunity to update KYC information, review the customer’s recent transactions and interactions with the Bank, and reaffirm that retaining the relationship continues to be appropriate.The periodic review is to be performed by the relationship owner and should:Ensure that KYC information is accurate, complete, and up-to-dateConsider the effects of any significant inflows, outflows, and any obvious changes in the accounts’ purposes, for appropriateness and consistency with expectations.Evaluate the customers’ general transaction volumes and overall balances across all products and services for reasonableness and consistency with the customer’s financial situation and the relationship’s stated purpose.Periodic reviews will occur at least every 12 months for high-risk customers and 24 for medium-risk customers.  The first month of each quarter, high risk accounts having a yearly anniversary in that quarter, based on the date of the assigned risk rating, will be identified.  During that three-month period}}
