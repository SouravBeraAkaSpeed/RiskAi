The current customer safe deposit data is as follows:   CDARsJ. Wallace does not presently participate in The Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”) Reciprocal Program offered by Promontory Interfinancial Network, LLC. In the future, J. Wallace will take this program into consideration if there is sufficient demand and neutral costs. CDARS is a service that enables financial institutions to provide access to FDIC insurance on certificates of deposit investments of $50 million and above. All participants are regulated financial institutions. Should J. Wallace participate at a later date, the Bank places its own customer’s funds that are over the FDIC deposit insurance limit with CDARS and gets the matching funds back from CDARS. J. WALLACE would perform CIP/CDD on all customers and verify the source of funds on all deposits. New Products and ServicesIn addition to senior management and the Board of Directors approval, new products must be approved by the new product committee and BSA Officer dependent on apparent risk. During FYE 16 the following Retail products were introduced:Diamond Money Market – September 2015Westwood Business Money Markey AccountAs of May 4, 2016 J. Wallace Bank has joined Allpoint Network, which means J. Wallace Bank customers now have access to America’s largest surcharge-free ATM network, with some 55,000 surcharge-free ATMs worldwide.In addition to J. Wallace Bank’s branch locations and ATMs, with Allpoint Network, J. Wallace Bank customers will never be far away from surcharge-free ATM access to their cash, especially in the United States where Allpoint offers 43,000 cash machines in places they're already visiting as part of their daily routine. Conveniently located in destination retail outlets including major discount retailers, convenience, grocery and pharmacy stores, Allpoint Network ATMs save customers of J. Wallace Bank time in addition to ATM fees. Currency Transaction ReportingJ. WALLACE has established CTR recordkeeping and reporting policy and procedures. There have been some removals from the CTR Exemption List since FYE 2015 and stands at 6 customers. For FYE 2016 there were 2,529 Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) filed through FinCEN’s BSA E-Filing System. This is an increase of 151 or 6.35% over the 2,378 filed for FYE 2015. These reports are system prepared by Patriot Officer, reviewed by the branches where the transactions took place and then reviewed again and approved by the BSA Department before filing. The majority of these CTRs are for customers who do not qualify for exemptions because of the type of services they provide their customers, e.g. sell money orders or transfer funds for Western Union.CTRs Filed FYE 20162,529FYE 20152,378 1516.35%Suspicious Activity Transaction Monitoring Transaction Monitoring SoftwareSenior Management has determined that Global Vision System’s Patriot Officer (anti-money laundering solution) provides the most suitable solution for the bank. Based upon an established timeline, the new AML transaction monitoring system went live in the 2Q of 2014. The new AML transaction monitoring system strengthens the bank’s transaction monitoring capabilities, creates a more efficient and effective department and over time will reduce the department’s workload.Patriot Officer Automated Anti-Money Laundering System is used to detect suspicious activity that is occurring at, through or against the Bank. During the assessment period BSA placed more emphasis on determining customer high risk transactional activity from account opening on. This process requires an initial 90 day review of anticipated activity documented at account opening versus the actual activity. There is currently no automated system in place to perform the 90 day reviews and the manual process is time consuming and not adequate. Patriot Officer does have a module, Dynamic Risk Module, which will assist with this process at no additional cost for its use, however the Bank has not received training in how to best utilize it. It has been recommended the Bank investigate the implementation of this module with the proper setup and training directly from Global Vision or another third party consultant. J. Wallace will be migrated to a new transaction monitoring system, PRIME, effective 11/11/16. The new system will create increased efficiency in the daily operations as PRIME interfaces directly with the bank’s operating system Bankway. Patriot Officer and Bankway do not currently have an effective interface.Transaction Monitoring ResultsSARs filedBreakdown of Alerts by DepartmentFYE 2016116BSA Department73FYE 2015115Branch Administration3 +10.8%76For FYE 2016 there were 116 Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) filed with FinCEN compared with 115 for FYE 2015, an increase of 0.8%.During the assessment period there were 76 new suspicious activity alerts reported and investigated. A breakdown of these alerts by department is as follows: BSA 73 and Branch Administration 3. The 76 new alerts did not all yield a SAR being file. 25 were labeled as “no further action” while the remainder was labeled as “SAR filed” or “Prepare SAR”.

The 116 SARs were filed as follows:Money Laundering: 55Structuring: 5Structuring/Money Laundering: 52Money Laundering/Possible Elder Abuse: 1Possible Elder Abuse: 1Structuring/Money Laundering/Elder Abuse: 1 Unusual Wires: 1 The BSA Officer prepares and presents a summary of the SARs filed from the previous month, including continuous SARs filed, to the Board of Directors. The BSA Officer, at the special request of the board, prepares an enhanced SAR report to identify specific patterns of suspicious activity.Crimes and Losses:Branch Robberies:During FYE 2016 there were no branch robberiesCheck, Reclamation, ATM, ACH and Debit Card Losses:For fiscal year 2016 (07/01/2015- 06/30/2016) J. Wallace Bank Cashier’s Checks continued to be counterfeited across the United States. In this scam, fraudsters would send a counterfeit J. Wallace Bank cashier’s check to persons buying/selling items on Craigslist or Online for jobs payments exceeding the amounts owed and request victims send remaining funds back to fraudster.  According to our records these counterfeit checks have, resulted in losses of $1,449,575.86 to victims outside of the J. Wallace Bank customer network.  t. Internally, J. Wallace Bank suffered one loss of $2,480 when a branch cashed one of these counterfeit J. Wallace Bank checks for a non-customer.Additional losses included fraudulent provisional credits and late ACH notifications resulting in a total loss of $4,550.92. For fiscal year 2016 (07/01/2015- 06/30/2016) there were reclamation losses of $3,615.84 with no recoveries. Reclamations losses were the result of returned funds to the US Treasury for benefits received for joint owner accounts and the funds were withdrawn before the reclamation was received. Collection efforts have been unsuccessful.  For fiscal year 2016 (07/01/2015- 06/30/2016) there were 123 claims of fraudulent ATM or debit card transactions totaling $30,951.53. We recovered $10,939.resulting in net losses of $20,012.36. The majority of the fraud claim loses were debit card numbers stolen with fraudulent cards reproduced and are signature based transactions. EBanking uses 3 separate 3rd party neural programs to detect and prevent fraud. When potential fraud is detected, customer contact is attempted and cards are closed down as warranted.The Deposit Operations Department is now using an automated Check Fraud Detection System (ASV) that is integrated with the FIS core processing system. The main features of this system compares signatures on checks from preciously received items, detects checks out of sequence, compares the check stock and duplicate checks (numbers) received. Internal Theft / Embezzlement:During FYE 2016 there was no branch Internal Theft or Embezzlement Identity Theft and Data Base Breaches:During FYE 2016 there were three (3) attempted Identity Thefts of customer’s information: 1-Branch notified security customer provided personal information to a person over the telephone. A subsequent unauthorized transfer of $1,000.00 from the customer's saving account to the customer's checking account was made. Branch Manager placed both accounts in a Frozen Status. Customer will close both account and open new ones on 12/16/2015 after a direct deposit is received on that date. 2-Customer alerted Branch that he received a phone call from an IRS scammer; he believed the scammer either had his social security number or customer furnished it to him. Customer is 85 years of age and does not wish to come to the branch and open a new account. Fraud Alert and Customer Comment placed in the CIF in Bankway. 3-A person contacted a Branch claiming to be a customer and had her Social Security number and asked for her account balance. Branch employee knows customer's voice and suspected it was not her and did not release any information. Branch contacted customer, who confirmed she did not make the call to the branch. Fraud alert added to customer CIP- Special Instructions added to all customer accounts. No Data Base Breaches during FYE 2016.The Bank did have 2 reports filed concerning Terrorist Financing in 2007 and 2008 that resulted in Subpoenas from the United States District Court / FBI. We filed one report for possible Terrorist Financing in 2010 and notified FinCEN’s Hotline and the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force. It was based on transactions taking place by a customer in the Middle East. Nothing was heard from the authorities and the activity ceased. There has been no other activity detected since then related to possible terrorist financing. SAR CommitteeThe SAR Review Committee consists of the: Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer; Senior Vice President & Chief Compliance Officer; and, if required, the President & Chief Executive Officer.If both the EVP and SVP do not concur with the BSA Officer’s recommendation the President will make the final decision.A recommendation can made be made by the BSA Officer to the Committee to terminate an account relationship after any SAR is filed if the BSA Officer believes continuing the relationship would be detrimental to the Bank. This would include a possible financial loss or potential harm to the bank’s reputation or a conflict of interest.After four (4) consecutive SARs are filed for the same customer for the same activity a customer will be referred to the Committee for action including the termination of their account relationship(s).ExceptionRegardless of the number of SARs filed an account relationship may be maintained upon request of a Law Enforcement Agency during the course of an investigation. For the assessment period, all recommendations by the BSA Officer to terminate a client relationship have been fulfilled.Bank StaffingJ. Wallace had a moderate turnover rate of 10% in branch personnel (CSRs, tellers, and branch management). The Bank considered the stability and actions of its staff with regard to insider fraud. The Bank recognizes that federal crime statistics reflect that money laundering and terrorist financing activity through financial institutions can often be influenced or assisted by internal staff. The Bank has not experienced personnel fraud during the current assessment period and minimal terminations resulting from procedural violations. There were no reports of terminated staff involved in fraud, money laundering or terrorist financing activities. Additionally there were no incidents involving employee mismanagement of funds leading to a loss to the Bank.The increase of illicit employee activity and possible income loss of the bank creates a need for a Know Your Employee (“KYE”) policy to be implemented by the BSA Department. As a matter of policy the BSA Department will create the KYE policy as a standalone or part of the KYC policy.The shortage of front line personnel in the branch offices remains a factor this year. Branch Managers are staffed in each branch as opposed to the last assessment period where two branch managers were needed and the locations were run by experienced assistant branch managers. None of the branches are in need of customer service representatives and one is in need of a senior teller. The Bank makes an effort to staff all branches with managers, assistant managers and senior tellers with current employees who have knowledge of J. Wallace products and procedures. The overall frontline personnel vacancy rate is currently 10% and is concentrated in the teller area, an area of concern. Human Resources is actively seeking experienced replacements through outside recruitment. Based on the continued rate of front line personnel vacancies with offices located in High Crime and Drug Risk Areas the Risk Assessment will remain as Moderate.Branch Openings by location:BranchEmployees on FMLTotal Open PositionsHackensackN/A0Cliffside PkN/A2TeaneckN/A1Palisade PkN/A0Hohokus11Twp of WashingtonN/A2FairmountN/A0WCLN/A0PatersonN/A0North BergenN/A0Park RidgeN/A0FairviewN/A0ShalerN/A0New MilfordN/A1Ridgefield PkN/A0Central AvenueN/A1EmersonN/A0BergenfieldN/A2RamseyN/A2Upper MontclairN/A1CliftonN/A1BergenlineN/A3SummitN/A0MonasteryN/A1Grand N/A1Total PopulationN/A187Total Current OpeningsN/A19Total Vacancy Rate010%Total Vacancy Rate  Tellers-14%  Total Vacancy Rate Supervisors- 5%  At the conclusion of the assessment period there were no employee vacancies in the BSA, Wire Transfer, eBanking or Deposit Operations Departments.

Wallace customers are U.S. citizens & residents and small to mid-size domestic businesses. The Bank considered the nature of its customers and the type of account opening activity, longevity of accounts, and transitory nature of its customers.  In addition, the commercial lending department has expanded our market area to surrounding states. Customer RiskThe Bank has established a risk rating and monitoring frequency system to mitigate the risks associated with money laundering and terrorist financing activity. The BSA Department determines the risk rating on every type of account by reviewing new and/or existing account criteria.When a new account is opened the procedures in the Branch Administration Procedures –New Deposit Accounts will be followed using the ChexSystems (DDA only) and Bridger Insight (all accounts) on-line programs. In the event that a match is found an individual at the bank will follow the steps in the “Processing an OFAC Hit” section of these procedures.The Bank’s use of the Lexis/Nexis Bridger Insight automated system provides immediate results when verifying that new customers are or are not on the Government’s Specially Designated Nations (SDN) or Palestinian Legislative Council (NS-PLC) Lists or any of the other 25+ Watch Lists the system monitors. Updates to the SDN and NS-PLC lists are compared to the Bank’s customer base within five (5) business days after each time those lists are updated.Other DepartmentsLoan Accounts, wire transfers in and wire transfers out, requests for donations, all require that a check of the OFAC list is performed prior to completion of the transaction. In the event that a match is found, the department should follow the steps outlined below in “Processing an OFAC Hit”By assigning a risk rating and monitoring frequency, the BSA Department. is able to maintain control of unusual or high-risk account activity. This system allows the BSA Department to effectively manage accounts and identify those accounts that may require enhanced due diligence (EDD).There are no overseas borrowers and all loan collateral is located in the U.S.A.The BSA team checks on OFAC compliance every time FinCEN publishes an update (usually daily) and reviews on-going OFAC screening results weekly.Customer profiles may change over time and it is important that a periodic review be performed so that risk rating and monitoring frequency reflects the risk profile of the relationship. Reviews by the BSA Department determine if the risk factors have significantly changed and whether a more appropriate risk rating and or monitoring frequency should be assigned.When a customer relationship is reviewed, it is important to review all factors including, but not limited to customer type, transactional activity, and volume or amount of transactions that influence the risk rating.Overseas Branches / Correspondent Accounts with Foreign BanksJ.

There have been no matches to date. As reported in previous assessments, these transactions have been mostly retail purchases (i.e. PayPal) by our customers and direct deposits of pensions to our customers’ accounts.  DateNumberDebitsCreditsJul-15188$5,074.29$10,165.52Aug-15167$7,346.91$11,970.79Sep-15179$4,508.49$18,475.79Oct-15176$14,817.24$12,957.64Nov-15173$5,248.31$12,164.67Dec-15191$6,050.16$13,769.33Jan-16177$10,492.08$7,798.10Feb-16155$6,192.02$13,994.25Mar-16182$5,228.99$21,001.47Apr-16220$5,492.19$11,618.89May-16181$4,749.01$5,761.22Jun-16214$7,484.41$20,043.76Total FYE 20162203$82,684.10$159,721.43Since the last review there have been significant increases in transaction numbers and totals.

Wallace has no communications from OFAC indicating compliance problems, and no history of OFAC violations, with a small number of transactions occurring in high risk jurisdictions relative to the transaction population. As such our inherent risk remains MODERATE.The purpose of the OFAC program is to completely comply with OFAC regulations, and to help ensure no funds are transferred into or out of accounts blocked in accordance with OFAC sanctions.J. Wallace Bank originates wire transfers, issues Official Checks, sells Travelers Checks and Gift Checks. The OFAC list is checked when the receiver of funds is not a customer to ensure that no transactions of any type are completed for entities that appear on the OFAC List. ACH activity is monitored on a daily basis with reports provided by Lexis/Nexis and FSI. OFAC searches on the originators are performed for all of these transactions.J. Wallace Bank has compliance procedures in place so that we are able to react to frequent changes to the sanction lists, and can identify accounts or transactions that would be subject to the sanctions, resulting in blocking, freezing, rejecting and reporting funds.Total compliance with OFAC sanctions requires a great deal of information, some of which may need to be obtained with legal assistance. Our procedures have been developed with this in mind, and do not address specific issues with specific governments or entities.
